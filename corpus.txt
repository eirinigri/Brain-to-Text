THEY DO A LOT OF LOW KEY SHOWS
SO IT SHOULD BE AN EASY DECISION RIGHT
HAVING GONE TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA
WE THINK THERE IS MORE TO THIS STORY
I'M SITTING HERE IN MY FORTY YEAR OLD HOUSE
WE ARE EXCITED TO BE LAUNCHING A NEW VERSION
NOT REALLY RATIONING WATER
THE WOMAN AND THE MAN BOTH LIKE THEIR CAT
YOU CAN'T MAKE A DECISION
MAKE VECTOR VERSIONS OF THE BOTTLENECKS
I LOVE THIS CARD GAME
IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS
I WORK SO HARD OVER THE WEEKEND
WE HOPE THERE WILL BE MORE NEXT WEEK
YES THEY HAVE
I LIKE THOSE A LOT
BAD MUSIC
HE AFFECTS A LOT OF PEOPLE
SOMEONE IS HERE ALREADY
NOW WE REALLY GET SICK
WE HAD A PARTY AFTER THE FINAL EXAM WAS OVER
YOU HAVE MUSIC
WE BOTH CAME OUT OF OUR SHELLS
TRUE TO LIFE
I KNOW THEY'RE REALLY PROUD OF THEIR INDEPENDENCE
I MUST CHANGE MY JOB SOON
MORE THAN TWO YEARS AGO
WE HAVE AN ELEVEN YEAR OLD SON
THE FIRST DEMONSTRATION OF A TOUCH SCREEN DISPLAY
MY PART IN THIS IS NOT VERY BIG
THAT REALLY GAVE US A LOT MORE SPACE
BEFORE THEY TOOK OFF THIS TIME
IT SEEMS LIKE WE PAY THE STATE
THE CREDIT CARD COMPANY
WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT
WE SHOULD CHECK THE COST FIRST
YOU SHOULD ENJOY YOUR TIME THERE
THEY CLEAN IT
I THOUGHT A GREAT DEAL OF IT
A VARIETY OF RESTAURANTS
NO CLOSER PLEASE
CHECK MY BALANCE AND MY BOOK
ARE YOU A NATIVE TO TEXAS
SHE SAID THERE WILL BE MORE PEOPLE
HIS BOOK WAS MENTIONED PROMINENTLY AND ATTRACTED MY CURIOSITY
IT'LL START STACKING UP
DO YOU FEEL IT
I'D LOVE TO JOIN YOU TO EAT
WHAT IS GOING ON THERE
LIKE IN EMERGENCIES
THEY COULDN'T DO A WHOLE LOT
THAT SEEMS LIKE AN EXPENSIVE POLICY
WE LIVE IN THE COUNTRY
I READ THOSE LITTLE SLIPS THAT COME IN YOUR MAIL
HOPE IS COMING
I GREW UP IN NEW JERSEY
YES THEY BRING IT
DO WHATEVER YOU NEED TO DO TO EARN SO MUCH MONEY
DON'T BUY THEM THAT WAY
CRAFT IS ABOUT RELATIVE PRECISION BETWEEN UNLIKE PARTS
SHE HAD JUST QUIT REHEARSAL ABOUT A HALF HOUR BEFORE
IT'S BEAUTIFULLY DONE
AT LEAST THE PARENTS DID
THE SAME TEAMS THAT WENT TO THE CHAMPIONSHIP LAST YEAR
THAT MIGHT BE A BETTER WAY TO DO IT
THAT'S ONE THING THAT I WISH WE HAD MORE OF
THE DECISION TO GO TO WAR IS WRONG
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT BUYING
IT CAME OUT IN THE FIRST WEEK OF THE YEAR
I CAN SKETCH SOMETHING FOR YOU TO LOOK AT
IT TAKES FOREVER TO GET A CALL THROUGH
I HEARD ABOUT IT ON MONDAY EVENING
I REALLY DISLIKE THOSE
PEPSI CANS AND WHATEVER
I FORGOT WE HAD TO HIT ONE
THEY FIXED US UP WITH AN OFFICE
I REALLY LIKE THOSE
WHICH IS A LOVELY PLACE TO GROW UP
THERE WAS A SHOOTING ON THE TOLLWAY
MAYBE IT'S NOT THAT FAR
WHO WENT WITH YOU TO THE CITY
I HAVE FOUND THIS NEW PLAY SET
INDUSTRY TYPE PLACES
PLEASE LEAVE ME ALONE FOR A WHILE
THE FIRST YEAR WE WERE LIVING THERE
I HOPE YOU LIKE YOUR NEW JOB
I WANT TO SHOW YOU THIS
YOU KNOW MORE AND MORE OF THEM ARE
TIME AND MISTAKES AND THEY'RE BOTH INEVITABLE
WE WERE ONCE VERY GOOD FRIENDS
I DON'T KNOW HOW PEOPLE DO IT WITH ONE
ALL OF THAT WAS NEW TO ME
WHO WOULD STEAL A NEWSPAPER
VERY INCIDENTAL
IT ALL DEPENDS ON YOUR INTEREST
I FORGET WHAT YOU CALL IT
WE HAD SOMEBODY DO IT
SHE NEEDS TO BE WALKED TWICE A DAY
IT'S NOT QUITE HOT ENOUGH TO BURN YOU
THEN I HEARD A VERY LOUD EXPLOSION
I'VE LIVED IN MY HOME FOR THIRTY YEARS
IT'S JUST A TERRIBLE CHOICE
GET THEM OUT THERE
FATHER LIKES TO WATCH TELEVISION IN THE EVENING
WE ARE GOING TO GO TO
IN OTHER COUNTRIES
WHO TOLD YOU THAT THE CITY IS IN THE NORTH
THEN YOU ONLY GO THERE AS A LAST RESORT
ESPECIALLY SINCE YOU HAVE A GERMAN SHEPHERD
PLEASE ENJOY YOUR STAY HERE
THE FRESH WATER TANK IS DIRTY
HELPING HIM LOCATE THE TOYS ON THE LIST
HAVE A DRINK OF SODA
LOOKING AT THE WHOLE THING WILL MAKE IT EASY
HOW MANY EMPLOYEES WORK IN THE STORE
THINK BEFORE YOU SAY ANYTHING
A LOT OF CHICKEN AND RICE
WHERE YOU LIKE
THAT DOES NOT GIVE PEOPLE INCENTIVE TO MAKE MORE MONEY
WHAT THE QUALIFICATIONS OF THE TEACHERS WERE
IGNORE THE OTHERS
EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT
RACE AND THINGS LIKE THAT I MEAN RIGHT NOW
I WAS THINKING WHAT HAPPENED WAS VERY UNUSUAL
SAY THE RICE DISH
THEY'RE OUT OF KOREA RIGHT
SHE DID RESEARCH ON IT AND EVERYTHING
I'D LIKE TO BE SPORTY
THERE'S PROBABLY A LOT OF NATURAL THINGS
I'VE HEARD THE NAME AND THAT'S ABOUT ALL IT GOES
BUT AT THAT POINT I WAS TOO FAR GONE
THEY TALK ABOUT THE NIGHTLY GUNFIRE
THAT'S THE ONE THING THAT REALLY DISCOURAGES ME
MOSTLY I HAVE JUST GIVEN THEM AWAY AS GIFTS
YOU'VE MADE THIS VERY CLEAR TO ME
THAT'S KIND OF THE WAY I FEEL
CHANGE THE TELEVISION CHANNEL
CHIPS AND SALSA
IF YOU CAN PULL IT OFF
TRUMP HAS SAID THERE WAS NO COLLUSION
OR WAS IT DURING THE LAST YEAR
WE HOLD A VISIONARY APPROACH
SUCCESS IS GOOD
IS MY NURSE THIRSTY
HE ALMOST WISHES THAT
I GUESS WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET AT IS
THE CITY IS NOT WHAT IT USED TO BE
I CAN GO WITH THEM AND COME BACK
I USED TO DO MORE BEFORE
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE TWO CARS
EVERYTHING IS STILL HERE IN THE HOUSE
THINGS LIKE MAILINGS
YOU KNOW A LITTLE
TWENTY FIVE IN INTEREST CHARGES
IT'S NOT WORTH THE TROUBLE
I CAN'T HEAR YOUR VOICE
I THINK IT'S LIKE ONE OR THE OTHER
GO HERE TO REGISTER AND LET YOUR VOICE BE HEARD
THE END OF THE CIVIL WAR
BRING MY NURSE
COLLEGE CAN BE A GREAT PLACE
YES YOU NEED IT
OUR CHILDREN ARE AWAY AT THIS TIME
WHERE DO YOU HAVE MUSIC
AMERICANS HAVE PUSHED THEM OUT OF THEIR NATIVE LAND
I LIKE MY COMPUTER
HELLO DO I NEED HELP
THE TWO MAIN STARS OF THE SHOW GOT MARRIED
IT IS THAT BAD
WHAT DID YOU READ IN THE PAPER
IT DOES SOUND VERY INTERESTING
WE'VE ENJOYED IT
THE ARMY SERGEANT MARRIED A WOMAN WHO ALREADY HAD KIDS
ACTUALLY THEY'RE FROM CANADA
I WOULD SAY IT IS NOT AS BAD AS NEW YORK
I DROVE A CAB WHEN I WAS A GRADUATE STUDENT
THE MEASURE NOW HEADS TO THE LOCAL GOVERMENT
DO YOU GET MONEY FOR IT
I FIND THAT VERY FUNNY
OF COURSE SO I THINK IT WILL BE APPROPRIATE TO START IT IN A FEW MINUTES AFTER WE BEGIN
I WAS JUST TRYING TO THINK
IT IS GOING OUTSIDE
WE HAVE ANOTHER DAY TO MAKE THIS RIGHT
I AM COMING UP
THEY ARE NOT
I'M IN TEXAS TOO
I KNOW THIS ONE WILL BE REALLY GOOD
SOME NIGHTS IT'S JUST REAL COLD
YOU HAVE
I CAN SKETCH SOMETHING
I DON'T KNOW HOW MY FATHER DID IT
ONLY FEW MORE DAYS TO GO
I WAS PAYING FOR IT MYSELF
THEY'RE USUALLY A PRETTY GOOD BET
TELL MY NURSE YOU ARE NOT HUNGRY
I SAW SOMETHING THE OTHER NIGHT ABOUT IT
I KNOW PEOPLE JUST COLLECT THEM LIKE THEY ARE
IT'S COLLECTING DUST RIGHT NOW
HER DAUGHTER ACTUALLY WAS
I HOPE YOU ARE GOING
I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT BEFORE
WERE HIS CIVIL RIGHTS VIOLATED
CAN YOU TELL ME YOUR NAME
I ALWAYS GO THERE ON MY WAY TO SCHOOL
THEY FEEL HUNGRY
IF YOU HAPPENED TO CLOSE IT ON HIM OR SOMETHING
PLEASURE TO MEET BOTH OF YOU
IT'S NOT UNUSUAL
ABSENT A DUST CLOUD THERE WILL BE NO EXPLOSION
THERE WAS VERY LITTLE EXTERNAL COMMUNICATION
I GUESS THAT IS WHAT YOU WOULD CALL IT
THE DECISION WILL GO INTO EFFECT IMMEDIATELY
IT WILL NOT COST THEM ANYTHING
BECAUSE THEY BRING GUNS TO SCHOOL
ENJOY AND FEEL FREE TO ASK QUESTIONS
YOU HAD PRETTY GOOD LUCK WITH ONE COAT TYPE PAINT
BEFORE HE WAS REALLY ACTIVE
HE ALWAYS HAS THIS
AS FAR AS THAT GOES I'M NOT SURE
WHICH IS KIND OF HIGH FOR LUNCH I GUESS
HE'S ALMOST A TEENAGER
BUT AS YOU POINTED OUT
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THIS CLASS
SO YOU HAVE A CHILD
THEY HAVE A NEW ONE NOW
WHEN THEY GET OUT
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU TODAY
I SAY THAT BUT REALLY I DON'T KNOW
YOU CAN GET OUT THERE AND TOY WITH THEM
WHAT IS WHERE
JUST GET RID OF THEM PLEASE
THEY'RE NOT AS NICE LOOKING
I DON'T HAVE LUCK WITH THAT TOMATO PLANT
THAT'S EXACTLY TRUE
IT'S BUSINESS AS USUAL
IT'S THE HARD WORK
SMOKING AND ALL THAT STUFF
I LOVED THE MOVIE
LITTLE FIELD TRIPS OR SOMETHING
I WANT HIM BACK BUT IT IS NOT MY DECISION
KIDS ARE HERE TO EAT
ADD A FEW DROPS OF EUCALYPTUS OIL TO THE WATER
PLEASE COME BACK AND TAKE CARE OF THIS
I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY A WHOLE LOT ABOUT THAT
I DO GET TIRED OF HAVING TO SEPARATE PAPER
THOSE WERE THE LAST TWO THAT I'VE SEEN
YOU PLAY THIS GAME WITH A JOY STICK
MONDAY NIGHT IS REAL GOOD WITH ME
ANY OF THE GUYS THAT WERE AROUND
DID YOU ENJOY THE CITY
I TOTALLY AM ALL FOR IT
I WAS NOT SURE THIS WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO
IN TERMS OF PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT IT'S BIG
IT REALLY IS NOT A BAD SUMMER AT ALL
WHAT WOULD BE MORE EFFICIENT ABOUT IT
SOME MORE THAN OTHERS
THAT VARIETY REPORT WILL MISS NUMBER OF POINTS
OF COURSE IT WAS WITH A GROUP
BECAUSE YOU OWN IT
WILL YOU GO BACK HOME RIGHT AWAY
I'VE BEEN THERE
THIS IS A VERY APPROPRIATE TOPIC
I BELIEVE THAT I HAVE MADE MY POINT
ACTUALLY I FIND IT INTERESTING
I CAN'T REMEMBER WHICH
I CANNOT STORE THIS MY HOUSE IS FULL
WE HAVEN'T BEEN THERE IN A WHILE
BUT THEY'VE CHANGED A LITTLE BIT EACH DAY
HISPANIC PLAYERS
WITH THIS PROBLEM
I WILL TAKE CARE OF THIS NEXT WEEK
THEY ARE TIRED
HE WAS TALKING TO HIMSELF AS USUAL
RAISE MY CHILDREN
MY BIRTHDAY WAS ON MONDAY
I HAVE BEEN A GOOD PERSON
AT LEAST SOMETHING COOLER
THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS HAS GATHERED FOR A MEETING
NO I HAVE NEVER ORGANIZED ONE
IN THE MIDDLE OF A RESIDENTIAL AREA
IT IS SOME TYPE OF LILY
WE'VE GOT SOME THIS YEAR
THOSE WERE THE GENERAL ISSUES
THEY STARTED WITHOUT ME
DO YOU HAVE ANY FRIENDS WITH OLDER CHILDREN
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ADVICE I'D GIVE THEM
I'M KIND OF SEMI RETIRED
MOST OF THE PARENTS
THIS NEW COMPANY POLICY IS GOOD
WHEN I COME BACK TO MY SEAT
DO YOU LIKE THE CLASSICS
WHICH IS A GOOD THING
IS THAT PORTLAND
I GOT A HOME COMPUTER TOO
THE LINCOLN RIDE IS CERTAINLY GOOD
FOOD IS A VERY INTRIGUING THING
YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN
EVEN IF THEY MADE THAT KIND OF MONEY
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I SAID
HOW OLD ARE YOUR BOYS
IT SEEMS THAT HAVING GONE THROUGH THAT IS NOT HELPFUL
THAT'S THE BIGGEST MESS I'VE EVER HEARD OF
BEING HOME WITH MY FAMILY BRINGS ME JOY
I REALLY WANT TO GO THERE
I HAVE MOSTLY SEEN MEN TALKING ABOUT IT
LEARN ABOUT VERSION CONTROL
THEY REALLY WERE SOMETHING ELSE
HALF OF THIS SIDE WAS AWFUL
SOMETIMES DECISIONS ARE MADE BEFORE A PUBLIC MEETING
HER LIFE WAS A LOT SIMPLER BACK THEN
THIS IS NOT A SUITABLE METHOD TO MEASURE AND RANK THE VALUE OF COINS
MY TEAM IS LIKE A FAMILY TO ME
OTHER LITTLE THINGS CAN ALWAYS WORK WELL HERE
I GUESS THIS IS QUITE REAL
WHERE ARE YOU GOING
PICK THIS PIECE UP AND MOVE IT TO THIS SIDE
FAITH IS VERY GOOD
THEY ARE DOING SUCH A TERRIFIC JOB BACK THERE
TELL MY NURSE I FEEL THIRSTY
IF I MISS SOMETHING BIG DEAL
I CAN SEE YOU FROM HERE
DOES ANYBODY CARE ABOUT THE GAME
THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE A DISPUTE
THANKS A LOT I ENJOYED TALKING TO YOU
WELL I DIDN'T KNOW THAT
WE LIVE IN THE SAGINAW AREA
HE WILL PAY FOR THIS
JUST MORE FACTS WOULD BE NICE
I FEEL BAD WHEN I SEE HOW INEFFICIENT EVERYTHING IS
VIOLENT CRIMES MUST BE PUNISHED
I'M NOT SURE I'D DO THAT
THAT'S VERY HARD TO DO
NEGLECT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
THESE ARE ALL INTERESTING CHOICES
A PRETTY SIGNIFICANTLY SMALL NUMBER
WIPE MY MOUTH WIPE MY MOUTH
HOW DID THE SITUATION GET TO THIS POINT
THOSE MILK CARTONS TAKE UP SO MUCH ROOM IN THE REFRIGERATOR
I WOULDN'T WANT TO EAT OCTOPUS
I HAVE STUCK TO WATER AEROBICS
WE'RE JUST FRIENDS
THEY THOUGHT IT WAS THE GREATEST FUN
HAVE IT
IT WAS NORTH OF US
YOU NEED GLASSES
AND OUR CITY WILL PICK UP OUR RECYCLABLES
I WOULD HOPE WE COULD DO THAT
THE DECISION WAS MADE BY HUMAN RESOURCES
HAVE ALL THIS FINE MEXICAN FOOD
IT WAS A WASTE OF PAPER
THEY ALL PLAY DIFFERENT SONGS
ARE YOU IN BUSINESS FOR YOURSELF
EXPLOITING STEREOTYPES OF ACADEMICS
I DON'T LIKE THIS SORT OF WORK
COUNTY I LIVE IN
I WANT TO BE ONE OF THE ONES THAT DECIDE
CHECK THE AIR QUALITY OUTSIDE
I ENJOY IT VERY MUCH
HE WAS PUT IN THE GARAGE
IT'S GOING TO BE ON A CRUISE
I HOPE YOU ENJOY IT AS MUCH AS I ENJOYED MAKING IT
I CAN SEE YOU NEXT WEEK
THEY'RE DOING THIS ON THEIR OWN
THREE BREAD ROLLS
WHICH AREAS ARE UNDER TESTING
ONE IS EIGHT YEARS OLD AND THE OTHER IS ELEVEN
IF I DON'T KNOW THE STORY LINE
NO IT IS NOT RIGHT
BASICALLY ENOUGH TO APPEAR TRUE
IF I HAD NOT BEEN PREPARING FOR THIS
NOBODY CAN APPRECIATE COMEDY ANY MORE THAN I CAN
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME TO GET TO READ FOR FUN
WHAT DO YOU ENJOY MOST ABOUT THE SPORT YOU PLAY
HE CAME TO LIVE WITH US FOR FOUR DAYS
WHAT DO THEY TELL MY FAMILY
WE GO OUT WITH FRIENDS
WELL I'LL BE WITH OTHER PEOPLE
WHAT OTHER SOCIAL CHANGES HAVE THERE BEEN IN THE PAST TEN YEARS
DID YOU ENJOY THIS VIDEO
IS MY FAMILY GOING UP
WHERE ARE YOU UP
PEOPLE ARE JUST LIKE THAT
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN HERE
IF WE DIDN'T HAVE IT
YOU GET THE DEATH PENALTY
DO YOU HAVE TO BE A FAN TO ENJOY IT
NOT IDENTIFY YOURSELF TO THE GOVERNMENT
SOME LUCK HELPS IN THE BASEBALL GAME
I'M AN ENGINEER BY TRADE
WHAT A FUN PLACE TO BE IN
TWO HUNDRED HOURS OF COMMUNITY SERVICE
ACTUALLY IT COMES OUT THIS FALL
HAS HE EVER BEEN YOUR FAVORITE PLAYER
YOU COULD PRETTY WELL GUESS WHERE IT WAS
I ENJOY HAVING A NICE LOOKING YARD
I HAVE HAD A LITTLE
I'M WEARING SHORTS
IT WAS CUTE BUT NOT THE BIGGEST LAUGH I'VE SEEN
SOMETIMES MY HUSBAND CLOGS THE TOILET
WORKING IN THAT CONDO
HOW MUCH WORK DO YOU GET DONE IN A DAY
THE ONLY KINDS OF THINGS THAT YOU CAN USE
WHO NEEDS A CHANGE
I AM COMING OUTSIDE
MY REAL HOME IS RIGHT HERE
I THINK THEY ALREADY DID THAT
THE AUDIENCE WAS GREAT
CAN YOU GET ME WATER
I WALKED IN THE DOOR
WHEN WILL YOU GO UP WITH THEM
HOW THIRSTY AM I
I AM AGAINST THE TAXES FOR THEM
MOSTLY JUST MOVIES
I MIGHT HAVE TO LEAVE VERY SOON
WE JUST GOT MARRIED
I GREW UP ON A FARM
DO YOU DO ANY HANDICRAFT TYPE THINGS
IT'S GOT TO HAVE AIR CONDITIONING
IF IT'S CHEVROLET
I WAS NOT IN ON THIS
THE OLDER KIDS HAD WANTED ONE FOR YEARS
NONE THAT I CAN THINK OF
OTHER PEOPLE DON'T THINK THIS WILL DO
THIS IS UNUSUAL FOR MY LOCAL FRIENDS
MY FATHER OWNS A LAWN MOWING COMPANY
YOU CAN PICK ANYTHING YOU WANT
NOW THAT'S ANOTHER ONE THAT I WANTED TO SEE
MOST OF US ARE GOING TO GO AWAY
WHAT IS OKAY
I HOPE YOU ARE
BUT I GUESS IT'S JUST LUCK
DO YOU THINK THIS IS A BAD IDEA
BUT I THINK I'D LIKE IT
I ALWAYS PUT CHEESE ON THEM
WHAT DO YOU BRING
I NEED MUSIC
WE DID HAVE BARBIES
WELFARE STATE BENEFITS
IT'S GOT A ROUNDED FRONT ON IT
IT WILL SAVE US MONEY
THIS CAPITAL CITY HAS MANY COMPANIES
THIS IS AS FAR AS I COME
WE'VE GOT FOUR KIDS
NOTHING IS AS BAD AS DRIVING IN THE CAPITAL
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE VIETNAM WAR
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FANTASTIC
I COULD HELP YOU FIND IT
HOW EASY IS IT TO SPEND ALL THE MONEY YOU EARN
IT'S REAL EASY TO SWING IN THERE FOR BREAKFAST
NO I AM NOT HUNGRY
WHAT IS YOUR BUDGET FOR THE HOUSE
MY SISTER IS VERY OVER ZEALOUS
WE WEREN'T ALL OUT TO BE TEACHERS
THEY DON'T THINK ANYTHING OF THAT
HE IS GOING TO NURSING SCHOOL
WE RARELY GO IN THERE
THEIR HOUSE IS GOING TO BE REALLY BIG
YOU WOULD BE SUSCEPTIBLE TO INJURY
PLEASE COME HOME SOON
THEY SHOULD HAVE ONE YEAR AND ONE APPEAL
IT WAS A QUIET AND RESTFUL WEEKEND
IS THERE ANY DEAL TO RECORD
SHE HAD THE BABY AND SHE WAS OUT IN TWO DAYS TIME
WHAT KIND OF MUSIC DO YOU LIKE TO LISTEN
OR WAS IT ROOSEVELT
THERE'S A LOT OF THEM
FIELD OF DREAMS WAS A GOOD MOVIE
THIS MATTER IS IN THE PAST
THE RECREATION CENTER FOR YOUTH
WHAT'S THAT YOU ARE LOOKING AT
WHERE WILL YOU GO FROM HERE
YOU HAVE THEIR BASIC NEEDS MET
THAT'S EXCELLENT ADVICE
IT WAS A POINT OF HONOUR WITH US NOT TO WHINE
MY VISION IS STARTING TO GO A LITTLE BLURRY
I DO NOT LIKE MY GLASSES
THE CORNEA HAS A CRUCIAL ROLE IN FOCUSING VISION
EVERY MEAL HAD A LITTLE BIT OF CURRY IN IT
HOW DO THEY HAVE MY COMPUTER
I USED TO DO THIS IN MY COLLEGE LIFE
THAT'S KIND OF UNDERSTANDABLE
THE GOVERNMENT OFFERS FINANCIAL SERVICES
DOES YOUR DOG LIKE TO PLAY WITH KIDS IN THIS BIG SPACE
I KNOW WE CAN MAKE THIS BETTER
I THINK WE'RE ALL CONTRIBUTORS
I JUST KIND OF DO IT
RETIRING TO FLORIDA IN THE LAST FEW YEARS
MY PARENTS WILL ALWAYS THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE
THAT PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT THEMSELVES NOW
SHE WAS TRYING TO CALL YOU A COUPLE OF TIMES
THEY SAY THAT IT IS
THEY ARE RECYCLING MORE LATELY
WHERE IS HELP
I MIGHT NOT GO TO WORK
THEY'RE JUST SORT OF INTO CLOTHES
SO HOW DO YOU AVOID THAT PROBLEM
I LOVE WHAT I AM DOING NOW
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR SURE
PLEASE KNOW YOU MADE THE RIGHT DECISION
A LOT OF THINGS WERE NO LONGER PUT TO USE
I WANT TO BUY A HOUSE IN THE CITY
THAT IS BETTER GIVE ME LEMON IN MY MOUTH
YOU STILL SEE THEM COMMITTING THE SAME CRIMES EVEN WITH POLICE OVERSIGHT
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IS AT THE END OF THIS
I THINK THAT WAS THE QUESTION
I WOULD SAY I'VE NEVER BEEN
I'M AN AMERICAN
MY IN LAWS LISTEN TO THE KIND OF MUSIC I HATE
COMPUTER IS NO GOOD
CONFUSION AT HOME
IT'S ALMOST RADICAL TO SOME PEOPLE
I LOOK AT HOMEMAKING AS A JOB ALSO
SOME DAYS IT'S REAL
COULD YOU BRING THAT PAPER WITH YOU
AMERICAN TEAMS DO QUITE WELL IN BASEBALL
I THOUGHT HE WAS KIND OF COCKY OR SOMETHING
I HOPE YOU HAVE GOOD GLASSES
I'VE GOT TWO KIDS TO PUT CLOTHES ONTO
I FEEL VERY GOOD
MY HUSBAND IS A VIETNAM VETERAN
IT MAKES ME LAUGH WHEN I READ THAT DECISION
THEY HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING
IT WAS OUT OF HIS HANDS AT THAT POINT
THE FAMILY IS HOME IN THE EVENING
WHAT IS MY FAITH
WHAT MADE YOU FEEL GOOD
ARE YOU MY NURSE
I WAS IN SUBMARINES
KEEPING THINGS CONCISE IS USUALLY THE WAY TO GO
MINE ARE MIXED UP TOO
YOUR MOTHER PROBABLY JUST WON'T SAY IT
YOU HOPE THAT
IT WILL BE LIKE FAMILY AROUND HER
WHEN I WAS GROWING UP IN CHICAGO
WHAT TIME DO YOU GET OFF FROM WORK
THEY DIDN'T START LOOKING FOR AN APARTMENT UNTIL NOW
I HAVE GLASSES LIKE THAT
WE SOLD OUR GROWING CAMPING COMPANY
THAT'S ALL I HAVE IS BOYS
I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS REAL LITTLE
I MADE A DECISION
MY TEAM WILL CALL YOU ABOUT THIS IN A BIT
SHE'S BEEN A GOOD DOG TO HAVE
THIS IS HOW AN OPERA IS SUPPOSED TO BE
I DON'T KNOW IF DALLAS IS IN THE TOP THREE
THAT IS YES
IT'S SHOW TIME
YOU PAY MORE TAXES
THESE BASIC NEEDS SHOULD BE MET
TELL MY NURSE I DO NOT FEEL THIRSTY
SEE OTHER PHRASES THAT WERE COINED IN THE USA
MY FRIENDS WILL AGREE TO GO TO CLASS
I AM AN ASIAN WOMAN WITH A WHITE BOYFRIEND
HE IS THE PRESIDENT AND HE SHOULD BE TRUSTWORTHY
IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT AT THIS POINT OF TIME
I KNOW THEY WILL
THOSE PATTERNS WERE WELL ESTABLISHED BEFORE
I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THEM
THAT HE SAYS WAS THE POINT
ANOTHER POINT FOR EXPOSURE THERAPY
YOU ARE NOT VERY HUNGRY
WHERE IS HOPE
YOU TAKE IT EASY
MY MOTHER WAS REAL HEAVY INTO CRAFTS
I LOVE CHINESE FOOD
THE IMAGE WAS FILTERED AND DISTORTED
I JUST THINK IT'S SUCH A FUN SPORT
WHERE DO YOU WORK OUT
WHAT DO YOU HAVE HERE
THANK YOU FOR YOUR GENEROSITY AND LOYALTY
HOW CAN WE MEASURE THIS
I HAVE TWO OTHER SISTERS AND MY MOTHER HAD US
I WILL PUT MY MONEY HERE
THEY REPORT FACTS
IN MASSACHUSETTS
WE HAVE THAT HERE
I NEED A FEW THINGS FROM MY WIFE WHEN SHE IS AVAILABLE AND THEN I AM ALL YOURS
YOU CAN MEET SOME REALLY NEAT PEOPLE
I DON'T FIND THIS FUNNY AT ALL
BETTER FIND A LAWYER
BECAUSE THE CRIMINALS KNOW THAT THE POLICE STATION IS HERE
I HAVE CHANGED MY MIND ABOUT RUNNING ON THE WEEKEND
SHE IS THE HEAD OF THIS COMPANY
THIS CASE IS STILL VERY NEW
WHERE IS MY SUCCESS
DO YOU STAY HOME WITH YOURS
WE WENT TO SIX FLAGS ON SATURDAY
YOU REALLY HAVE TO WATCH THOSE INTEREST RATES
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS
I HOPE YOU LIKE MY FAMILY
PEOPLE ARE JUST TOO DIFFERENT
WE'VE BEEN TO THE POUND
OVER A VERY LONG PERIOD OF TIME
WE DON'T USUALLY MIX
OUR VISION SHOULD BE CLEAR
IT WOULD NOT GET PERFORMED BY ANYBODY
DO YOU HAVE ANY PETS AT HOME
SO I THOUGHT THAT I WOULD PUT THAT THERE
WE'VE HAD A REAL PROBLEM HERE IN TEXAS
I MEAN I'M NOT A SERIOUS GOLFER AT ALL
NOW I REMEMBER IT
THEY'RE COOPERATIVE RATHER THAN COMPETITIVE
EITHER KEEP YOUR OLD STUFF OR BUY NEW THINGS
HE BOUGHT A MEASURING STICK
THEY HAVE DONE IT MANY TIMES OVER
IT BAKES UP REAL EASY AND IT'S DELICIOUS
I HOPE YOU FEEL BETTER SOON
IS IT PRETTY EASY
FOR ME IT IS A GOOD DECISION TO LEAVE
I HAVE ONE SISTER
THAT'S SOMETHING I'VE NEVER HAD TO DO
YOU DIDN'T HAVE ALL THE EXTRA EMPLOYEES
IT WAS WRECKED THREE WEEKS AGO
GOOD LUCK TO YOU IN PURSUING YOUR NURSING DEGREE
MOVE MY MY HEAD DOWN
I THOUGHT SHE WAS PRETTY GOOD IN THAT
THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES
THERE'S SOME DIFFERENT THINGS GOING ON NOW
MOST POINTS AT THE END WINS
I HAVE NO FAITH
IS THIS PAT I'M TALKING TO NOW
I MEAN YOU JUST GOT IT DONE
MY HOUSE HAS A LIVING ROOM
I BOUGHT A STATIONARY BIKE
SOMETHING MUST GO
THEY ARE NO GOOD
YOUR PRIVACY BEING INVADED AT ANY TIME
STUDYING ELECTRONIC TECHNOLOGY
ENJOY TODAY BECAUSE IT HOLDS UNLIMITED POSSIBILITIES
IT'S NOT TOO HARD
THEY WILL CATCH THAT GUY
TO HELP DECIDE WHAT THE RIGHT THING TO DO IS
WHAT LIMITS OUGHT TO BE PUT ON IT
IT'S ALSO DESIGNED TO LINE THE POCKETS OF LAWYERS
I REALLY ENJOY YOUR COMPANY
HAVE YOU HAD ANY EXPERIENCE WITH IT AT ALL
I REMEMBER THERE WAS A TIME
TV'S A SURROGATE PARENT
IS IT A WAY OF RAISING THE PRICES OF ILLEGAL GUNS
THEY'VE GOT A NICE ONE
WE'RE OUT HERE IN THE WAREHOUSE
MY KIDS WILL COME HOME SOON
IF YOU EVER GO IN A RESTAURANT
THIS IS WHAT OUR FOLDER LOOKS LIKE AT THIS POINT
THEY NEED IT COMING
I HAVE TO CUT MYSELF DOWN TO THE WEEKEND
IT'S REALLY BOTH REASONS
THAT'S NOT TRUE AT ALL
DO YOU HAVE IT HERE
ARE YOU VERY HUNGRY
YOU WANT TO BUY SOMETHING
MY WIFE SAID TO WATER THE ROSES EVERY OTHER DAY
THE ACCUSED HAS THE RIGHT TO A SPEEDY TRIAL
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
BUSINESS EXPERIENCE WILL BE IMPORTANT
I HOPE THEY HELP YOU
IT SEEMS LIKE IF YOU'RE GETTING TO THAT LEVEL
I WENT TO VISIT ENGLAND
I CAN'T NECESSARILY BLAME THEM
YOU NEED TO GET AN UPDATED MACHINE
HOW MANY OF THESE COINS WILL WE NEED
TAKING A LOT OF TIME
I DIDN'T NOTICE IT
OTHERS ARE NOT RISING TO THE OCCASION
PLEASE TELL MY NURSE I AM GOOD
IT IS A NEW COMPANY CALLED PRIME AIR
HE WAS JUST BESIDE HIMSELF
YOUR DECISION IS A WISE ONE
WE PUT SOME NEWSPAPERS DOWN ON THE FLOOR
YOU MAY WAIT HERE IN THIS ROOM
HOW GOOD IS IT
THEY HAVEN'T MASS PRODUCED ENOUGH TO DO THAT
THAT CAN REALLY SLOW YOU DOWN
IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THEY ARE DOING MUCH WITH IT
I LIKE HOW THEY TELL IT
THE TIME FRAME WHICH THEY GET PAID
I AM NOT SURE IF I CAN DO THIS
I OFTEN MAKE GOOD FOOD
I DO AND IT IS READY TO GO ON THE LEFT MONITOR IT IS A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT THE BOSTON CELTICS BASKETBALL TEAM
HE COULD BUY US MATERIAL THINGS
GET ON THE SKI LIFT
HE DIDN'T EAT FLIES
I FEEL VERY TIRED
I DON'T KNOW WHY IT'S SO HARD TO FIND
THE TEACHERS EXPECT IT
SHE WENT HOME LAST WEEK
MY PARENTS ALWAYS SAID IF WE WANTED A CAR WE HAD TO BUY IT OURSELVES
WE'RE NOT BUILT LIKE THAT
THEY STARTED TO TURN TOO SOON
A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF THEIR SALARY WOULD GO TO IT
I AM GOING IN
MY FRIEND SAID THAT THEIR SERVICE WAS BAD
IF YOU DO IT RIGHT I THINK IT COMES OUT EVEN
MINE WAS ACTUALLY VERY FUNNY
HE'S FISHED ALL OVER THE UNITED STATES
THAT'S REALLY ABOUT IT
NO I DO NOT FEEL VERY GOOD
SHE WAS ABOUT ELEVEN YEARS OLD AT THE TIME
NO YOU ARE NOT GOING
I'M JUST SPEAKING OVERALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY
I COULD NOT BELIEVE IT
HOW ARE THINGS AT HOME
DO YOU WANT TO PLAY OUTSIDE
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I DID
MY DECISION IS ALREADY MADE
THAT WAS A GREAT LITTLE CAR
IT'S A GOOD MOVIE
THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF DEATH ROW
HE IS MORE DEDICATED TO THE ISSUES
AND THIS OTHER GIRL WAS NOT JOYFUL
HOW ARE YOU DOING TODAY
OKAY AM I GOING
MY DAUGHTER LOVES THE LITTLE MERMAID
I WANT TO EAT WITH MY FAMILY
WHAT DID YOU THINK OF MY SPEECH
I LIVE IN A ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT
THEY ARE YOU
IT'S HARD TO JUDGE
THAT WAS A LOT OF FUN
HOW DO YOU HAVE THAT
ONLY TO THE AIRPORT
HAVE YOU BEEN TO ANY LATELY
I USE A THREE IRON OFF THE TEE
AIR IN THE COUNTRY IS CLEAN
HOW ABOUT YOU
THE PROS AND CONS OF BOTH
I WANT TO SPEND A COUPLE OF HOURS ON THIS
COMPANIES DRUG TESTING PRIOR TO HIRING
MY FAMILY IS GOING HERE
THAT'S THE NUTS AND BOLTS OF THE LAW
IT WAS BUSINESS AS USUAL AS THE BAND PLAYED ON
ACTORS IN THE OLD WESTERN MOVIES
AFTER A LONG SEMESTER I FINALLY PASSED THE CLASS
WHAT DID YOU DO BEFORE THIS
YOU JUST GET USED TO THE WEATHER
THE NEWS IN THE PAPER IS MOSTLY PUBLIC NOW
JUST LET ME SEE WHAT I GOT
I HOPE WE HAVE LUCK WITH THIS
OUR BABY'S QUILT
NEW HOME SITUATION
IT'S KIND OF RAINY ACTUALLY
MY HOUSE IS REALLY NOT THAT FAR
I HADN'T HEARD ABOUT THAT
SOME PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE UPSET ABOUT THIS
WE LIVED UP NORTH LONG ENOUGH TO APPRECIATE THE COLD
A WAYS BACK WE DID LIKE CONVERSIONS
IT WAS JUST WONDERFUL
IT IS STILL GOING ON THROUGH THE WEEKEND
I CAN'T TALK I HAD CHOCOLATE
I HAD REALLY LIKED TURQUOISE
HE WILL RUN TO THE SCHOOL TODAY
I HAVE NOT SEEN YOU IN CLASS FOR A WHILE
YOU ARE GOING TO FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF
I GUESS I'M LIKE A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE
STICK IT IN THE HOLE
EDUCATION IS NOT A LUXURY ITEM
YOU USUALLY HAVE TO GROW UP WITH IT TO ENJOY IT
GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS
THE MONITORING IS NOT THAT BAD
SLEEPING MUCH MORE OR LESS THAN USUAL
SHE CAN'T RUN IN THE MORNING
DON'T THEY HAVE A POINT
WHO SPONSORS YOU
THE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT
THAT PICTURE IS RIGHT OUT OF A MAGAZINE
YOU HAVE GOT TO HAVE IT
WE NEVER HAD ANY GUNS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
DO YOU THINK RUSSIA IS STILL A THREAT
WE DON'T THROW ANY MONEY AWAY
CAN YOU TURN OFF THAT MUSIC
I ORIGINALLY WANTED TO TAKE THIS ART CLASS
THE CAR INSURANCE IS DUE
COULD YOU GET MINE TOO PLEASE
WE JUST COULDN'T
IT IS HARD TO REMEMBER
I HOPE IT IS NOT GOODBYE
WE WILL NEED A SAW TO CUT THIS
YOU'VE HAD MORE FREEZING THIS WINTER
WHEN WAS IT
THEY COULD TAKE OFF AT ANY MOMENT
CAN YOU SELL THIS PIECE TO ME OR IS IT FREE
THEIR CREDIT IS VERY HIGH AT THIS POINT
SHE'S MUCH HAPPIER THESE DAYS
EVERY SIX MONTHS I HAVE TO PAY MY TAXES
JEEZ AND YOU CAN'T TAKE THE CHANCES
THE STABLE PONIES DO NOT LET ME CLOSE TO THEM USUALLY
IT WOULD HAVE TO DO WITH POVERTY
A BOLD DECISION HAS BEEN MADE
ARE YOU COMING CLOSER
I FEEL VERY GOOD ABOUT THIS
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE FINALLY GOING TO DO
THE INSURANCE RATES ARE REAL HIGH ON YOUR CAR
ALL OF THE INNOVATION IS ON ANDROID RIGHT NOW
HOW COULD YOU SAY THIS TO ME
WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING IS ACTUALLY A CONFLICT
WHAT TIME IS IT
A LOT OF PEOPLE I KNOW
LONG STORY SHORT
YOU MAY LOOK AT THIS SOCIAL SITUATION
YOUR BABY WILL ENJOY HIS VISIT
I HOPE I HAVE GOOD GLASSES
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT DECISION
WHAT WAS THE VERDICT
CAUSE THEY ALL GREW UP IN NEW YORK CITY
I'M STILL REPLACING THAT IN THE BACK
UP UNTIL THIS POINT IT REALLY HASN'T BEEN
IT WAS A FRIENDLY OUTDOOR DOG
SOME COUSINS I HADN'T SEEN IN A LONG TIME
THOSE JURORS DON'T KNOW
WHAT IS IT WHERE
ALWAYS PUSHING ME
WE FEED THE CATFISH EVERY MORNING
ONCE THAT WAS ACCOMPLISHED EVERYTHING WAS GOOD
THEY CAN GO BACK AND LOOK AT IT
WE WILL HEAD TO FLORIDA FOR VACATION
I SEE THIS IS BETTER THAN BEFORE
THERE IS SOME CONFUSION ABOUT THIS PROGRAM
HOPE YOU ARE NOT HUNGRY
MUSIC IS NOT GOOD
I DON'T LIKE THIS ANYMORE I THINK
BOTH OF US ARE GOING
I REALLY TRY TO WATCH WHAT THEY WATCH
WHETHER IT IS SCIENCE FICTION OR FANTASY
DO YOU BELIEVE IN ME
I NEVER HAVE DONE THAT BEFORE
ABOVE ALL WHAT I WANT TO DO IS ENJOY IT
JUST BEING EXCELLENT
OH THAT WOULD BE HARD
PLEASE TURN AROUND AND COME HOME
YOU KNOW IF I HAD TO PUT SOMEONE IN THERE IT WOULDN'T BE HIM
MOSTLY WHAT I WEAR ARE SKIRTS AND BLOUSES
I WILL FEEL MUCH BETTER AFTER THIS
THIS MUSIC SOUNDS WONDERFUL
WOULD NOT BE AN UNREASONABLE THING
I DO HAVE A PERSONAL COMPUTER ON MY DESK HERE
EVERY OTHER HOUSE
PLEASE BRING IT
THERE'S LIFE IN THERE
EACH OF US SHOULD THINK ABOUT RECYCLING
IN TIN FOIL AND MATCH BOXES
THE CHILDREN WERE LEFT UNATTENDED IN A ROOM
THE DECISION WILL MOVE BACK DOWN
I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THE NAME
THIS COMPANY PAID VERY WELL
I HOPE YOU DO NOT NEED FAITH
THE GRASS IS ALWAYS GREENER ON THE OTHER SIDE
AT THIS POINT THE ANSWER IS IRRELEVANT
SHE GOT A COUPLE OF NEW DRESSES
COME TO SEE OUR NEW HOUSE
IT'S NICE FOR THEM
COULD YOU PUT THAT IN THE CAR
WHAT HAVE YOUR SHOWS BEEN LIKE UP TO THIS POINT
WE'VE GOT SO MANY WHEN HE WAS A PUPPY
MY FATHER STATES THAT THIS AMOUNT IS IMPORTANT
MORE MORE MORE
I DON'T REALLY FOLLOW BASKETBALL VERY CLOSELY
WE WOUND UP WRITING THEM A LETTER
YOUR VOICE IS GETTING BETTER
WE WANT TO SELL OUR HOUSE IN THE CITY
YOU UP
THEY NEED IT COMING UP
A MEAL WITHOUT ANY VEGETABLES AT ALL
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE IN MIND
I CARE ABOUT IT VERY MUCH AND SO SHOULD YOU
MY WHOLE FAMILY IS HOME
YOUR LICENSE COULD BE REVOKED
OKAY WHAT IS GOOD HERE
YOU PROBABLY HAVE ALL KINDS OF TREES
ABOUT THIRTY THREE THOUSAND MILES A YEAR
THEY FINALLY DETERMINED WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS
WHAT DOES THIS HOUSE COST
IT'S HARD TO PINPOINT ANY ONE THING
MY OTHER HOUSE IS CLOSE BY
I USED A THREE WOOD RATHER THAN A DRIVER
THEN THEY HAVE TO WORK UNTIL THE SHOP CLOSES
THEY MENTIONED THAT ONE ONLY BRIEFLY
I HOPE THEY DO NOT NEED MY MUSIC
NOT RIGHT
WE ARE ALL FINE HERE
MUSIC IS HERE
WE JUST MADE A DECISION AND MOVED ON
I ENJOY GOING TO THE BEACH AND TO BEACH AREAS
TO GO TO THEM FIRST
KIND OF LIKE THE ITALIAN
I DIDN'T SEE THAT
I FELT SO SORRY FOR HIM AFTER THAT
I WANT TO PICK A NICE PLACE FOR MY PARENTS TO VISIT
THEY DO NOT NEED IT
MY FAMILY'S NOT VERY BIG
SHE'LL EVEN TELL HER FRIENDS
I'VE DONE SOME OTHER THINGS TOO
THIS WILL COST US FIVE HOURS AND TEN MINUTES
BUT I GOT TALKED INTO BUYING THIS BICYCLE INSTEAD
THERE'S NOTHING NEW IN THE SHOP
IT WAS ON HIS WAY THERE
AT THE PRESENT TIME
I'VE ONLY BEEN HERE A COUPLE OF YEARS
HOPEFULLY THE NEW ONES WILL BE A LOT BETTER
PESTICIDES ARE POISONOUS
A GOOD HOUSE FOR A VERY NICE FAMILY
HERE IS WHAT
I THINK IT DOES HELP
IT'S A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS
IF IT'S LIFE AND A DAY
THIS PERSON WILL LEAVE EVERYTHING FOR THE KIDS
AND SO I'VE SEEN A VARIETY OF BENEFITS
EVERYBODY HAS A DIFFERENT THING THAT THEY ENJOY
WHEN YOU DECIDE TO MAKE THE STEP
MAYBE YOU WOULD ENJOY IT
PEOPLE BELIEVE A CAT HAS NINE LIVES
I WENT TO CALIFORNIA TO SEE THE SEQUOIA TREES
YOU FEEL BAD
TOGETHER THESE ARE TWO SIDES OF THE SAME COIN
EVEN THOUGH THEY DIDN'T BRING IT INSIDE
WE HOPE YOU ENJOY OUR LITTLE PROJECT
YOU HAVE TO LIVE WITH THE CHOICE YOU MADE
IF I WERE TO COOK
WE WENT ROUND AND ROUND WITH THE MANUFACTURER
INTERESTING TO WATCH
WHEN OUR DAUGHTER WAS LOOKING AT COLLEGES
LIKE A BRISKET OR A ROAST
IF A CHILD IS A VISUAL LEARNER
THE PLAYERS USUALLY VOTE
WHAT'S THE NAME OF THIS BOOK AGAIN
BUSINESS MEANS MAKING HARD CHOICES
WE DID IT LAST TIME
WE LIVE NEXT TO THE SCHOOL
I WAS CAREFUL TO KEEP HER AWAY
THE JUDGE SENTENCED THEM TO THREE LIFE TIMES
THAT IS THE REASON I DON'T
SINCE I'VE HAD CATS AT HOME
I TOLD MY HUSBAND
BUT IT'S WELL WORTH IT AND EVERYTHING
PLEASE HAVE FAITH
CHILDREN ARE SO FULL OF ENERGY
I REALLY WANTED TO GO OUT THERE AND ENJOY IT
DO YOU WANT TO START
MY FAMILY IS COMING CLOSER
OUR DAUGHTER IS THE LIGHT OF THIS FAMILY
YOUR QUESTIONS WERE HEARD
WE DON'T LISTEN TO THE RADIO AT WORK AT ALL
THERE SHOULD BE SOME CONTROL OF THAT
RATHER ODD PERSONALITY
I DON'T KNOW HOW COST EFFICIENT THAT WOULD BE
THE CONTINENTAL BREAKFAST CAN BE PRETTY GOOD SOMETIMES
I'M A DOG PERSON
SELL YOU MAGAZINES
MY WIFE IS CLEAR ON THIS TOPIC
IT WAS A BITTERSWEET JOY
THAT'S THAT MICROSCOPIC STUFF
I WAS IN THE SERVICE
WHEN CAN WE GO TO THE CITY
IT'S PROBABLY THAT WAY ANYWHERE
I GOT A TWELVE YEAR OLD
IN THE REGULAR TRASH
IT'S SO DARNED EASY TO TURN THE THING ON
I AM NOT GOOD
A LITTLE BIT MORE PROGRESSIVE
WHY WAS THIS DECISION MADE AND WHY NOW
THAT'S REALLY NEAT
THEY DO NOT NEED MUSIC
WE USE LESS OIL TO COOK OUR FOOD
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT
IT'S REALLY HARD TO FIND SOMETHING THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE
I HAD THE BRAKES REPLACED ON MY CAR
WE ARE NOT TRYING TO MISTREAT THEM OR ANYTHING
I DON'T USE THE FREE WEIGHTS
FISH CHUNKS AND DIP IT IN THE FONDUE
ENOUGH HAS BEEN SAID ALREADY
THAT'S THE ONLY ONE I WATCH WHENEVER I'M TIRED
HE CAME TO SCHOOL UP HERE
DO IT LIKE THAT
WE CAN'T LIVE IN THIS CITY
GIVE ME YOUR NAME CARD
SO WHO DO YOU THINK IS GOING TO WIN THE PLAYOFFS
WE LIKE TO GO MINIATURE GOLFING AND TO MOVIES
IT'S JUST VERY WONDERFUL
SEVERAL BUGS HAD SOMEHOW GOTTEN INSIDE
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT IT
NOW IT'S LOOKING BETTER TO ME
DOESN'T SEEM LIKE WE HAVE GOT MUCH
NOT TO GO THE SAME TIME ALL THE TIME
TELL MY FAMILY I AM NOT COMFORTABLE
I MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE LOOKED AT THE TELEVISION GUIDE
THEY SOLD THEIR BIG OLD HOUSE IN THE CITY
CONCLUSIONS AND WHERE TO GO FROM HERE
MOST PEOPLE DIDN'T ENJOY THIS PLAY
BUT YOU GOT TO LIKE QUEEN ALSO
IT'S KIND OF ODD THAT THEY ONLY PICK TWO WINNERS
STICK THAT HERE ON THE PAPER
IN SECOND GRADE
MY MOTHER HAS THE BIGGEST HEART
LET'S PLAY CARDS ON THE WEEKEND
IT PROTECTS YOU FROM ACID AND CORROSION
I HAVE A GARDEN
I WILL JOIN THIS COMPANY VERY SOON
MOST OF THESE ARE QUITE OLD
I ENDED UP WATCHING A LOT OF THESE TYPES OF SHOWS ON TELEVISION
JUST TO DEAL WITH TRASH
A PERSON'S HEART CAN BE CHANGED
THEY BUY THEM FROM YOU
IT WAS A TWO STORY BUILDING
THE OWNER'S RESPONSIBILITY
TWELVE WEEK OLD BABY
THEY ARE VERY GOOD
THAT MAKE A DECENT SALARY
I DON'T HAVE AS MUCH TIME
GIVE THIS TO ME RIGHT NOW
THESE GUYS WANT ATTENTION
I HAVEN'T GONE OUT TO CHECK YET
A WELL KNOWN CHAIN
HOW MANY YEARS HAS IT BEEN
WE CAMPED NEXT TO ONE
I HOPE YOU ALL ENJOYED IT
OUR COLLEGE IS QUITE INTERESTING
HAVE YOU TAKEN A LOT OF VACATIONS TOGETHER
I WILL NOT CHANGE YOUR MIND
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD COMPANY
MY NURSE IS NOT VERY TIRED
AND SEE WHAT YOU FEEL IS BEST FOR YOU
MY FIRST COMMENTS ON THE BUDGET
I SET FIRE TO THE PLACE
AVOIDING STUDENT LOAN DEBT
HOPE YOU LIKE IT
THOUGH I CAN'T LET YOU IN YOU CAN STAY OUT HERE
SKIRT AND BLOUSE OR SUIT OR DRESS
JUST WHEN I THOUGHT I REALLY ENJOYED MY NEW HOBBY
WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUR HERE
I GOT IN ON THE GROUND FLOOR
PLEASE GET IN THE LINE
THERE'S TOO MANY CHOICES
A LITTLE BOY FELL DOWN
I JUST NEVER HAVE IT
IT IS WHAT THEY HAVE
YOU ARE GOOD HELP
I DON'T EITHER
THE CRIME PROBLEMS THAT THEY'RE HAVING THERE ARE TERRIBLE
HOW OFTEN DOES SOMEBODY READ THIS BOOK
WE TRY TO GO SO OFTEN
WE EXPECTED BETTER QUALITY IN THE PAST
FRIEND OF HERS AT WORK
AND HE BIT INTO IT
TO ME THAT'S THE SAME THING
THIS WORK WILL TAKE A COUPLE OF DAYS
FIFTEEN FEET WIDE
ANY ADVANTAGE THAT THEY CAN TAKE
THAT'S GOT TO BE A BEAUTIFUL PLACE TO VISIT
IS IT A BOY OR A GIRL
TELL MY FAMILY THEY ARE NOT THIRSTY
THIS IS SUCH A GREAT START TO THE JOB
IT DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING
ARE YOU SURE THEY SAID THAT
I THINK THIS IS FOR THE BEST
I AM TRYING TO SAY THE SAME THING
I CAUGHT UP IN A CLASS I AM TAKING
INNOCENT PEOPLE COULD DO THAT
LINUX VERSION
THAT IS ANOTHER WAY OF THINKING
I'M A REAL MOVIE BUFF
LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT OUR WORK
EVEN AT HOME HERE NOW
I'VE HEARD ABOUT HIM
PLEASE TELL MY FAMILY I NEED MY GLASSES
OUR NEEDS CHANGE OVER TIME
THEY FEEL VERY GOOD
WHAT'S THE SPECIAL OCCASION
THEY STILL LOOK PRETTY GOOD
I HEARD ABOUT IT THOUGH
I GUESS BECAUSE WE DON'T GO OUT THAT MUCH
BECAUSE OF THE EXPLOSION THE REFINERY SHUT DOWN FOR MONTHS
THE ENGINE WAS PRETTY GOOD
AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT IS
MY PARENTS MADE DIFFICULT DECISIONS EASIER FOR ME
WE HAVE ONE DOWN HERE IN THE SUMMERTIME
YOU HAVE FAITH
THE LUXURY TRAVEL EXPERIENCE WAS VERY NICE
WE GOT MARRIED JUST A FEW MILES FROM HERE
I REALLY LIKE THOSE AND I HAVE KIDS
I THINK YOU'LL LIKE IT BETTER
I WORK IN FACILITIES AND HAPPEN TO HAVE THE KEY WITH ME
IT WAS THE WORST ONE THAT I HAVE SEEN
DO THAT PLEASE
WELL DON'T YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S FREE
ARE THEY VERY THIRSTY
THIS LOCAL COMPANY WILL PICK UP
IT IS MY PLEASURE TO BE ABLE TO SHOW YOU MY CITY
CLEAN UP BRING IT HERE
IT'S NOT GOOD FOR A SECOND WATCHING PARTICULARLY
LIVING UNDER BUDGET IS DIFFICULT IN THE CITY
THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FIND HIM
DO YOU THINK THAT'S A GOOD TRY
MY BABY THINKS HIS FATHER IS VERY FUNNY
I'M GOING OUT OF TOWN THIS WEEKEND
DO YOU HAVE A HUNDRED DOLLARS
IT MIGHT BE KIND OF SCARY
THEY WILL START NEW GAME THIS FALL SEASON
I DON'T HAVE A REAL LOVE FOR MIAMI ANYWAY
SO THAT REALLY EFFECTS HOW THEY REPORT THE NEWS
THEY'VE COME FROM SO FAR DOWN
EACH MOVE WILL GET THEM CLOSE TO THE CITY
I'LL THINK OF THEM IN A MINUTE
VERY MUCH COMPARED TO MY MOTHER IN LAW
I MIGHT FIND A JOB THAT HAS FLEXIBLE HOURS
YOU BAG YOUR OWN GROCERIES
WHICH SEASON IS YOUR FAVOURITE
WHAT DO THEY BRING
PARENTS DO NOT DO THAT
IT WAS JUST NO EFFORT AT ALL
WHICH PLACES DO YOU LIKE TO VISIT
I HOPE THEY NEED MY FAITH
I WAS NOT LOOKING AT IT AT THAT TIME
JUST FOR THAT REASON
YOU MUST KNOW HIM
IF YOU ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH IT
YES MY NURSE IS COMING HERE
I'M QUITE SATISFIED WITH THE WAY THEY DID IT
I GUESS THAT'S BECAUSE WE HAD SO MUCH RAIN
IT'S A GOOD TOWN
THAT'S WHAT THEY LOOK AT IT AS
HAVE A LESS CONSCIENTIOUS EFFORT
I UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S VERY LATE
HAVE A GOOD EVENING
CONTACT POINTS
DON'T GET MUCH ROOM IN THE ATTIC
ALL OF US COULD USE ONE ELECTRIC CAR RIGHT NOW
DIDN'T GET THAT FAR
HE CLEANED UP MY MESS
I HAVEN'T REALLY HEARD MUCH ABOUT THAT RECENTLY
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT
AND THEY WENT TO COURT OVER IT
THE GRAYING OF AMERICA
THAT'S ALWAYS FUN
ABOUT TWENTY THREE YEARS
WHEN YOU HAVE KIDS
I CAN'T IMAGINE SPENDING THAT MUCH MONEY
I THINK THEY'RE ALL BAD
I'M NOT MUCH OF A BASKETBALL FAN EITHER
I WOULD HAVE MORE PROBLEM
I'M NOT SURPRISED
A HIGH SCHOOL COURSE
THE BOY WAS CONSCIOUS AND BREATHING POLICE SAID
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN IN SAN ANTONIO
IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THIS FACT
THE MUSIC IN THAT MOVIE WAS FANTASTIC
YOU HAVE IT HERE
WHAT A LIGHT SHOW
HOPE THEY FEEL RIGHT
THIS IS ANOTHER THING TO MEASURE
THEY ARE CLEAN
BUT I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY EVEN MADE IT
HOW FAR ARE WE FROM THE CITY
MOST OF VIRGINIA IS CLAY
THERE'S VERY LITTLE FULL EMPLOYMENT
MIX SOME CREAM SAUCE WITH IT AND POUR IT OVER RICE
YOU JUST DON'T HAVE ANY TIME TO DO ANYTHING
I USED TO GO THERE WITH MY FAMILY
ALL OF MY FAMILY LIVES ONE PLACE
COMPANIES ARE TRYING TO FORM GREAT TEAMS
YES YOU ARE RIGHT
TO ME IT'S AMAZING
MY DAUGHTER WAS THERE TO HELP
CRIME AND CASUALTIES WILL GO UP
WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT
IF YOU ARE GOOD WE CAN GO GET ICE CREAM
IT IS QUITE WARM FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR
THIS IS VERY GOOD
YOU HOPE IT IS GOODBYE
A LOT OF THINGS
LUCKILY SOMEONE CAME BY AND GAVE ME A RIDE
I'M ORIGINALLY FROM KANSAS
SPORTS SECTION IN THE NEWSPAPER
THERE'S JUST NOT ANY PUSH TO RECYCLE
HOW DO THEY DO IT HERE
BASIC INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR EVERYONE
I LIKE MY SUCCESS
I THINK I WENT BY LOCATION FOR ONE THING
YOU'RE THE FARTHEST PERSON I'VE EVER TALKED TO
THERE'S NOT THAT MUCH TIME LEFT ON THE LOAN
IT MUST BE DEPRESSING FOR THE PEOPLE WHO DO
THAT'S TOO BAD
THIS IS GOING TO BE THE ONLY ONE
WE ARE VERY CLOSE TO THE COLLEGE
WE HAVE MILES TO GO
I HOPE YOU LIKE MY COMPUTER
WAS IT A CIVIL OR CRIMINAL TRIAL
MOSTLY WITH ADOLESCENTS
IT'S A GOOD SHOW
WE ALL KNOW THAT THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY TRUE
SO SINCE OCTOBER THEN
AND THAT'S WHAT HE SAID
TEACHERS ARE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THIS TOPIC
THERE COULD BE A LOT OF OPTIONS
I CAUGHT THE END OF THAT
IT MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE
THIS IS JUST ANOTHER THING TO REMEMBER
I DON'T CARE FOR THE SOUND OF THE HIGH NOTES
I AM TALKING TO YOU
I THINK THAT'S ALL THEY'RE GOING TO PICK UP
I ALSO REMEMBER AN ILLUSTRATED VERSION OF THIS STORY
VOICE OF THE PEOPLE
IT'S QUITE EASY FOR YOU
IS IT YES
HE JUST SHOT THEM HIMSELF
I MEAN IT IS GREAT TO BE WELL ROUNDED
WE HAD SOME SORT OF PASTA OR SOMETHING
ARE YOU CERTAIN THAT THESE ARE BASEBALL CLOTHES
I NEVER GUESS ANYTHING
DO YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR THAT
OUT ENJOYING THE WATER AND SUCH
I DO CONTRACT WORK
THAT'S WHY I ENJOY GOING TO RESTAURANTS
FAITH IS NOT GOOD
WHAT IS AN ANDROID TV BOX AND WHAT CAN THEY DO
IT'S A SHAME
IF YOU ASK MY FRIENDS THEY WOULD SAY I'M A BIG TALKER
WE'RE A LONG WAY AWAY
IN DECEMBER OR JANUARY
WHAT DO THEY DO
YES OUR POWER IS OUT
IT HELPS IF YOU LEAVE THE PIT IN IT
YOU HAVE A GOOD RATIO OF GOOD TO BAD
HERE ARE YOUR TALKING POINTS FOR THE PRESS CONFERENCE
PUBLIC EXECUTION WHERE IT'S VISIBLE
HOW MANY FRIENDS DO YOU HAVE
I HAVE A WIFE AND TWO CHILDREN
DO YOU HAVE SOME VACATION TIME
AIDS EPIDEMIC NOW
WHAT'S THE BEST METHOD
I CAME HERE LOOKING FOR YOU
WHY ARE YOU AFTER THIS OLD CAR
I HOPE YOU DO GOOD
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A GREAT TIME
IT'S ONLY ABOUT TEN BUCKS A MONTH
THE NICE THING I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO
MORE MEN IN THE CROWD JOIN IN
BE CAREFUL YOU DON'T GET STUNG
OBAMA IMMEDIATELY SAID HE WOULD VETO THE MEASURE
PLEASE TAKE THIS BACK WITH YOU
I ALWAYS CALL HER WHEN I AM THERE
PATRIOTS WERE SO DEPRESSING THIS LAST YEAR
WHAT ELSE HAVE I DONE
I'VE ALWAYS WONDERED HOW HE GETS AROUND
I DO NOT LIKE MY MUSIC
I CARE ABOUT MY SCHOOL VERY MUCH
YOU HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE HERE AS FAR AS I KNOW
A JOB TO MAKE MONEY
YOU FEEL GOOD
BUT DO YOU HAVE TO REALLY WAIT
NO I DO NOT FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE
THAT'S MY HUSBAND MARK
WE NEVER HAD ANY IN THE HOUSE
I CAUGHT THE DISEASE FROM MY FATHER
WHAT KIND OF PLACE IS THIS
JUST HOPING MAYBE
IT DEPENDS ON YOUR LIVING SITUATION
SOMEONE PROBABLY KNOWS ABOUT THIS
THEN WE CAME BACK HOME AND ATE A FEAST
I LOVED THE SECOND REPORT
MAYBE WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT IT A BIT MORE
IT JUST HAS A REALLY BAD PROBLEM
IT IS COMING CLOSER
WHAT ARE YOU DOING OVER THERE
IT IS NOT KNOWN HOW LONG THE CLOSURE WILL LAST
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT AGREE WITH THE JURY
WE GENERALLY ORDER PIZZA IN
YOU NEED MY FAITH
A LOT OF THAT TO WOMEN WORKING
I'M NOT SURE IF THAT WAS IN ARIZONA
I WAS JUST EXPRESSING MY FRUSTRATION
IF YOU LET ONE LITTLE LAW GET THROUGH
NOT AS FAR AS THIS COUNTRY IS CONCERNED
I WANT TO BE THERE FROM THE START OF THE MOVIE
THAT IS NOT TERRIBLE
IT DOESN'T MATTER ANYMORE
THEIR TRAINING ISN'T WHAT WE NEED IN THIS COUNTRY
YOU DON'T HAVE MUCH SPARE TIME EITHER
YOU GOT YOUR MONEY'S WORTH
ONLY THE HEAD TEACHER AT THE SCHOOL CAN MAKE THIS DECISION
I'VE GOT TWO BABIES
THE DEATH PENALTY
MAN ROBBED AT GUNPOINT WHILE WALKING HOME
LOTS OF AFFECTION
WE TRY TO PICK UP LOCAL FOOD
I DO SOCIAL WORK FOR A LIVING
THESE MEASURES WILL HELP US
SHOWER AND GET DRESSED
IT WASN'T EVEN FUNNY
I'D LEFT HIM A CHECK FOR TAX
IF THERE'S A GAME ON
WE WERE GOING TO UPGRADE TO A LARGER ONE
ONE OF THEIR FAVORITES
THESE PEOPLE ARE VERY KIND
I CAN FIX EVERY CAR IN THE WORLD
HAVE YOU BEEN BUYING ANY CLOTHES LATELY
JOIN THE BETA AND GET EARLY ACCESS
WHERE YOU NEED IT
TELL MY NURSE THEY ARE NOT THIRSTY
THIS IS AN INTERESTING POINT
WHAT ARE WE DOING
WE ARE NOT REAL CONSISTENT WITH THIS
RIGHT IN OUR OWN BACK DOOR
PLEASE TELL MY FAMILY I NEED MY COMPUTER
AID TO OTHER COUNTRIES
SOME OF US WILL GO THERE FIRST
NOT IN A CIVILIZED SOCIETY
MY FAMILY IS GOOD
THIS SHOW CAME ON WHERE THESE PEOPLE HAD TO SURVIVE IN THE WILD
WE'VE GOT TO TALK
THEY ARE VERY EXPENSIVE
THE SOUTHWEST MEDICAL CENTER
I PLAY THE PIANO
I AM NOT VERY THIRSTY
WHO GAVE YOU THIS CREDIT CARD
HELLO
AND I HAD GOTTEN HOME SHORTLY BEFORE THAT
OR A ROW OF SEATS ACTUALLY
I REALLY ENJOY MY TIME IN THE CITY
IT WAS INTERESTING
IT IS HARD TO HAVE FUN WHEN YOU HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL WITH THIS BOY
YOU MADE ME DO THIS
MARCH THE FIFTEENTH BEFORE IT WAS PREPARED
I DON'T THINK THEY KNOW
I'M KIND OF A CAR BUFF MYSELF
ARE YOU BOTH DOING THE SAME JOB
THAT IS A BIG EXPENDITURE
HAVING TO MEASURE THIS EVERY DAY IS NO FUN
WILL YOU HEAD HOME AFTER COLLEGE
I DON'T MAKE ANY MONEY
THAT'S A GOOD OPTION TO CONSIDER
MAKE SURE YOU READ IT AGAIN
I CAN WALK TO GET THE BOOKS
HOW IS THAT GOING
A DRESSING OF OIL AND VINEGAR
THE TROUBLE WITH SOME OF THEM I KNOW
IT IS EASIER TO BE EARLY THAN LATE
WE'VE HAD HER NOW FOR ABOUT THREE YEARS
WE NEED MORE WATER
FIVE DIFFERENT WAYS
PLACES LIKE ROSS DRESS FOR LESS
PUT THEM ON DEATH ROW AND EXECUTE THEM
THEY ARE FORWARD LOOKING PEOPLE
I HOPE I NEED MY MUSIC
EVERYBODY THAT I TALK TO IS IN DALLAS TEXAS
I THINK I DO IT SUBCONSCIOUSLY
I JUST GRADUATED IN MAY
HAVE YOU EVER READ THE BOOK NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR
THE TOWN IS JUST OVER THE HILL HERE
A NURSING HOME OR ANYTHING
IT ISN'T A VERY WISE DECISION
THESE ARE TWO SEPARATE ISSUES
IT DOESN'T FIT THE CIRCUMSTANCE ANYMORE
I THINK IT'S FOUR CUPS OF FLOUR
THEY WILL ACCEPT YOU LATER IN LIFE ALSO
WE'RE GOING TO FEEL IT WATCH OUT
I LIFT WEIGHTS QUITE A BIT
WE HAVE THE MOST LOYAL PEOPLE
IF YOU PLAN A YEAR AHEAD
SO I CAN WANDER AROUND
MY CHILD HAS A WONDERFUL FRIEND
GO PLAY OUTSIDE
OUR CHURCH EACH YEAR
YOUR CASE IS DIFFERENT THAN USUAL
I AM VERY GOOD
I HAVEN'T QUITE FIGURED THAT OUT
I'VE JUST NEVER BEEN CALLED UP
FUSED COINS ARE FREE COINS
THEY'RE DOING GOOD TONIGHT
THAT'S A BIG PROBLEM
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOUR PART OF THE COUNTRY
EVERYBODY LOVES THEIR CAR
WE CAN HELP YOU MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICE
THE NEXT TIME I'M GOING TO TRY TO
PEOPLE WILL COME LOOKING FOR WATER IN THIS BIG OLD HOUSE
WHAT KIND OF PET DO YOU HAVE
ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AGO
VERY LOW NOISE FLOOR
THAT SOUNDS FUN TOO
WE MAYBE WANT TO OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT
DO YOU EXERCISE
I WILL AGREE WITH THAT
QUITE A LONG WAY AWAY
I AM NOT RIGHT
ONE OF THOSE GENERATION NOVELS
THIS SITUATION DEPENDS ON SOME LUCK AND HARD WORK
I KNOW WHY I LOVE A STICK SHIFT
EVEN IF SHE DOES GET ON FLAT GROUND
IT IS EASY TO SEE THAT THERE'S NOTHING HOLY ABOUT IT
I DON'T MEAN YOU SHOULD GO THERE RIGHT NOW
WE GUARANTEE YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED
THE WORK PLACE ENVIRONMENT
WE SHOULD LEAVE EARLY TODAY TO GET AHEAD
I LIKE HOW COMFORTABLE YOU ARE
THIS IS A LITTLE CONTAINER
OUR CHILDREN ARE NOW ELEVEN AND NINE YEARS OLD
ACTUALLY IT'S VERY EASY FOR ME TO GET AROUND WITHOUT A CAR
SOMEHOW THAT JUST SEEMS WEIRD TO ME
AS FAR AS THE GOVERNMENT IS CONCERNED YOU DON'T EXIST
ARE YOU TWO MARRIED
I KNOW YOU LIKE IT
THEY SHOULD KEEP THESE PEOPLE IN PRISON
I KNOW THIS BECAUSE I HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE
THE JURY IS EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE ITS DECISION
TWENTY SUCH PEOPLE CAME HERE LAST WEEK
ARE YOU FREE THIS EVENING
THIS WAS NOT IN OUR VISUAL FIELD
I LIKE THAT KIND OF STUFF
I'D PROBABLY HAVE SOME CHOICE WORDS FOR THEM
CLEAN UP
ESPECIALLY WITH TEENAGERS
LET US FIND OUT WHAT YOU NEED
THEY'RE BANNED FROM EUROPE
PLEASE COME TO SEE OUR WORK
I HAVE A LOT TO DO
PLEASE TELL MY NURSE I NEED MY MUSIC
THAT GUY WAS TALKING TO MY FATHER
MY COMPUTER IS GOOD
WHO'S YOUR FAVOURITE TEACHER
I JUST WANT TO GET DOWN AND KISS THE GROUND
YOU'D BE A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY CENTIMETERS
WE WILL PROBABLY SOMETHING LIKE THAT
WHICH WAS ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO
MY VISION IS GOOD FOR THIS GAME
I MOSTLY LISTEN TO POPULAR MUSIC
I HOPE MY NURSE IS CLOSER
IT WAS OVERNIGHT
CAN YOU GUESS THIS MOVIE
THEY LIKE GOING OUTSIDE
HOW DO THEY DO IT RIGHT
THE REST OF SOCIETY
BRING FAITH HERE PLEASE
YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT THIS THAN ME
ARE YOU GOING TO TRADE IT IN ON THIS NEW ONE
GOOD FAITH
PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT
I CAN VIEW THE SITUATION MYSELF
DEPENDING ON WHAT MY CLASS SCHEDULE LOOKS LIKE
NO I AM NOT VERY TIRED
IT IS VERY COMFORTABLE TO DRIVE
BUT HE SAYS THE EXACT NUMBER IS HARD TO PINPOINT
SHE SAID IN A VOICE THAT WAS ALMOST A MOAN
IF THEY'RE GOING TO OFFER THESE SERVICES
WHAT DO YOU HAVE
YOUR TIME WILL COME
GOODBYE I AM GOING
EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE SOON
FINDING THE TIME IS HARD
I HAD TWO KIDS IN THE HOSPITAL IN JULY
IF I ABSOLUTELY HAD TO HAVE SOMETHING I WOULD BUY IT
ARE YOU COMING UP
COLLEGE WILL NOT BE EASY
THE MONEY PART OF IT IS NOT AS REWARDING
DO YOU USUALLY GO OUT AT NIGHT
I CAN STAY HERE FOR FEW MORE DAYS
THEY FEEL COMFORTABLE
IS THAT WHAT COMES IN THOSE LITTLE BLOCKS
AVOID TOO MUCH OIL IN YOUR FOOD
I TELL YOU I DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE
YOU ARE WHAT
WHEN HE WENT CAMPING LAST YEAR IN BEAVERS BEND
I LIVE ABOUT TWO HOURS NORTH EAST OF PITTSBURGH
I GOT A DOUBLE MAJOR
I WAS TRYING TO THINK IF THERE WAS ANYTHING ELSE
AND I THINK MOST OF THEM HAVE AGREED TO THAT NOW
THEY'RE EIGHT AND TEN
HOW DO YOU LIKE IT
IT'S SOMETHING YOU CAN ALL HELP WITH
OF COURSE I WILL COME
PLEASE COME HERE NOW
DO YOU LIVE IN PENNSYLVANIA
I'M ABOUT EIGHT MILES SOUTH OF IT
THERE'S THIS ONE
I HOPE THEY HAVE
THE DECISION TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES WAS APPROVED
I DON'T WANT TO SET ALL THE TRASH IN MY YARD
ACTUALLY AS A MATTER OF FACT
YOU HOPE MY NURSE IS GOOD
LIFE OF A PERSON
IT WORKS OUT REAL NICE
AM I RIGHT
WHAT IS THAT LIKE
I DO NOT NEED MY COMPUTER
FIRST AN ALPHABET IS DEVELOPED
ON THE COMPUTER WHERE YOU CAN READ THE DAILY
I'M AT WORK TODAY
I MET THEM A COUPLE OF TIMES BEFORE
THIS WILL APPEAL TO BOTH GIRLS AND BOYS
IT WOULD WORK OUT
IT TOOK US FOUR DAYS TO DRIVE ACROSS THE COUNTRY
EVERYTHING IS TAKING MORE TIME
SO I CALLED THEM AND ASKED IF I COULD PARTICIPATE
I KNOW THE TAXES ARE A LOT HIGHER
THIS JOB IS BETTER THAN MOST
I DO SKIM OVER IT
HE WAS ALSO KIND OF TOUGH
THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH ONE GUY LIKE THAT
IT WAS WORTH THE BUCK I GUESS
THEY'RE DANGEROUS
THEY DO NOT HAVE FAITH
I HOPE I HAVE GOOD FAMILY
IT IS IMPORTANT FOR ME TO SPEND TIME WITH KIDS
HAVEN'T HAD ANY PARAKEETS FOR QUITE A WHILE
NO RAIN IN THE LAST MONTH
WHAT ARE WE DOING WITH THESE PEOPLE
AT LEAST RUSSIA HAS SOME SORT OF STRONG LEADER
OCCASIONALLY THE CONVERSATION TURNS INTO AN ARGUMENT
IS IT NOT GOOD
THEY'LL HAVE A SATELLITE CAMPUS IN A MONTH
I WATCH A SHOW THAT I LIKE
SHE IS AN INDOOR DOG MOST OF THE TIME
OR IN TERMS OF THEIR OPINIONS
FILLING OUT THE FORMS AND ALSO ALL OF THESE
I FEEL BAD ABOUT LEAVING YOU ALONE
COULD YOU TAKE IT OFF NOW
WHY DID YOU SAY THAT TO YOUR HUSBAND
YOU ARE COMING HERE
GOING THROUGH THE CITY IS HARD
I WATCH HER KIDS ON THE WEEKEND
IT WAS ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED PAGES
THEY GOT MARRIED IN DALLAS
WE'VE TAKEN THAT APPROACH THIS YEAR
THE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT THERE
THERE WAS NO NAME TO IT
YOUR HARD WORK WILL PAY OFF
PLEASE WALK FAST IF YOU DON'T WANT TO RUN
REALLY ANNOY A LOT OF PEOPLE
GERMANY IS A LITTLE OVER FIVE THOUSAND MILES FROM HERE
PLEASE COME BACK HOME SOON
THEN THEY'LL PAY YOU A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY
I HAVE IT LIKE THAT
THEN I WON'T TELL YOU
I AM LATE AND WILL MISS MY CLASS
FAMILIES NEED TO SPEND QUALITY TIME TOGETHER
ONE OF THE CALLS I'D GOTTEN BEFORE
ARE YOU AN ARTS MAJOR IN THE COLLAGE
YOU DON'T THINK OF IT THAT WAY DO YOU
BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW
HE IS COMING TO STAY WITH US FOR ONE MONTH
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I JUST HAVE NO TOLERANCE FOR THAT TYPE OF BEHAVIOR
I HAVE OTHER VIEWS ON THE SUBJECT
BECAUSE HE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH LEUKEMIA
IF THEY STARTED EXECUTING THEM ON A REGULAR BASIS
IT'S THE ONE THAT I GREW UP WITH
SHE IS AWAY FOR A WEEK
EVERYTHING HAPPENED IN KINDERGARTEN
NOW WHERE DO THEY LIVE
FEEL LIKE SUCCESS
I TAKE NO PLEASURE IN SEEING ANYONE GET INJURED
I DID NOT LIKE GIVING IT OUT FOR FREE
THEY HOPE I HAVE MY GLASSES
THERE'S AN OLD SAYING ABOUT IT
WHY DO YOU DO THIS
IT IS A FAIRLY LARGE LIBERAL ARTS COLLEGE AS WELL
SHE WAS CHARGED WITH MURDER
IT'S A TOUGH DECISION HE SAID
YOU STILL HAVE TO GO
HOW IS THAT GOOD
THE RESULT OF THE TEST WAS NEGATIVE
AVERAGE INTELLIGENCE OR SOMETHING
I WATCH A LOT OF TELEVISION
IF HE'S GOING TO DO IT
ALL KINDS OF PHYSICAL PROBLEMS
THEY RUIN SOMEONE ELSE'S LIFE
MY DAUGHTER THINKS THERE ARE BETTER PLACES TO VISIT
SOMEBODY WILL SAY SOMETHING ABOUT IT
I AVOIDED HIM
YOU DO THAT
THEY FINALLY FOUND EVIDENCE OF A CRIME
WE ARE GOOD PEOPLE
I ENJOY MY JOB
PROBABLY THE MOST POPULAR ONE IS SOLD OUT
DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER SIBLINGS
WILL YOU PLAY WITH THE BABY
MY CHILDREN BROUGHT IT TO MY ATTENTION
WE NEED ONLY FIVE OF THESE RIGHT NOW
ARE YOU IN SAN ANTONIO
SOMETIMES THIS IS ENOUGH FOR ME
I HAVE TO GO TO WORK WHETHER I WANT TO OR NOT
A SHADOW OF A DOUBT
THAT'S WAY OUT OF MY REACH
I THINK IT IS GONE NOW
PLEASE WAIT FOR ME I'M RUNNING LATE
THAT'S A BIG PART OF MY DECISION
ANY TYPE OF EMOTIONAL
I GUESS WE'RE BOTH PRETTY PRACTICAL PEOPLE
HALF OF MY CLASS WENT TO WATCH THIS MOVIE
ONE ENGINEER SAID IT WAS REALLY AN EDUCATION
WHEN SHE CAME UP HERE
THERE'S NO REASON THAT WE SHOULDN'T DO IT
NO I FEEL VERY GOOD
THERE WILL BE PENALTIES AND FINES AND PUNISHMENT
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO VOLUNTARILY SAY
WE SHOULD RECORD THIS SOMEWHERE
WHAT IS THE STATE OF YOUR COMPANY NOW
THEY JUST ARE FASCINATED WITH SCIENCE
IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO
GOODBYE THEY ARE COMING
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE IN
I'M NOT THAT UP ON THE POLICY OF WAYS
THEY TALK ABOUT THE WIND CHILL HERE ALL THE TIME
IT IS KIND OF A NICE SMELL AFTER A WHILE
I AM HAPPY TO GO HIKING
WHEN I READ MY MAGAZINES AT HOME
MAYBE WE CAN KEEP SOME OF THIS
MY IDEA POINTS TO THE SAME THING
I TELL YOU I FEEL COMFORTABLE
THEY WON BY THIRTY OR FORTY POINTS
THAT DID THE DAMAGE
I HAVE A REALLY EASY RECIPE FOR THAT
THAT'S A LONG TIME
OKAY YOU ARE UP
THAT IS A VERY COLD COUNTRY
YOU ORDER A MEAL
HOW MUCH MONEY IS THIS
WHATEVER YOU ARE PROMISED
SO THAT'S GOT EVERYBODY EXCITED
THEY LIKE MY GLASSES
AT THIS POINT MY LIPS HAD BEGUN TO BURN
I'M KIND OF LEARNING THIS
THAT REALLY ADDS UP TOO
THEY ADVOCATE FOR THE HOMELESS
THIS WAS THREE YEARS AGO
THE FIRST THREE DAYS
I WILL CERTAINLY TAKE A LOOK AT IT LATER TODAY
GOOD MORNING BOYS AND GIRLS
A SLAP HERE AND THERE
THAT'S WHAT I WAS GOING TO POINT OUT
THIS WILL BE THE BIGGEST EVENING OF THE YEAR
I LIKE THE WAY YOU COOK
JUST BY NOT KNOWING
IT WAS A DECISION HE WOULD COME TO REGRET
THE JUNK MAIL THAT I GET IN THE MAIL IS SO ANNOYING
THEY ARE TO BE THERE AHEAD OF TIME
I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO
THEY ARE BOTH REMARRIED
WATER AND AIR IN THE COUNTRY ARE CLEAR
I DON'T KNOW IF THEY WON VERY MANY GAMES
THAT SOUNDS SO EASY
I MEAN TO USE ANY OF THE FACILITIES
SHE WAS GONE BY THE TIME I GOT THERE
HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT THE FUTURE
I SANG IN THE CHOIR AT CHURCH
OTHER TEAMS HAVE MORE POWER
I HAVE DISCOVERED THAT
WE NEED TO BUY MORE AND MORE OF THEM
WE QUIT THAT ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO
DO YOU GO SEE A LOT OF MUSICALS
WHERE YOU GOING
YOU'LL SPEND ALL YOUR LIFE WORKING
I HOPE YOU ENJOY MY BLOG
I WISH I KNEW MORE TO TELL YOU WHY
YOU ARE
COMING UP
I LIKE TO WATCH THAT SHOW
THAT'S OVER FIVE MONTHS WORTH
I COULDN'T HAVE STARTED WITHOUT YOU
IT WAS A REAL RARITY
DOES IT JUSTIFY THE COST
PLEASE TELL MY NURSE WHERE YOU ARE
BEFORE THREE YEARS OLD THEY ARE QUITE SMALL
I FAVOR DOGS OVER CATS ACTUALLY
THAT WAS A TURNING POINT IN THE WAR
HIS CROP GOT KILLED BY THE BIRDS
IF WE EVER HAD A HIGH SCHOOL REUNION
THEY HAD PEOPLE WHO DID THAT FOR THEM
I DECIDED TO DO IT I HAVEN'T TALKED BEFORE
IF YOU IMPOSE
SPOILER ALERT
THAT'S WHAT ALWAYS AMAZES ME
I KIND OF LIKE THE COWBOYS I GUESS
A PLACE CALLED QUALITY AUTO PARTS
SHE IS ON MATERNITY LEAVE
SIX THOUSAND IS JUST GETTING BROKEN IN FOR THEM
WE GET ALONG FANTASTICALLY
HIS VOICE ROSE
I THINK THAT A COMPANY OR A BOSS COULD USE THIS
TRY TO THINK ABOUT IT FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW
DO THEY HAVE IT BAD
YOU ARE FREQUENTLY EXPLOITED
WE ALWAYS DO THOUGH
IN A SITUATION LIKE THAT MAYBE IT WOULD BE BETTER
SHE DIDN'T FEEL THAT PUBLIC SCHOOLS WERE SAFE
EXERCISE IS ALWAYS GOOD FOR YOU
THAT'S INTERESTING YOU SAY THAT
I'M AT THE THEATER
HE IS A THERAPIST BY TRADE
IT'S A TELECOMMUNICATIONS TYPE OF COMPANY
SHE LOVED THE STYLING OF IT
I'M UP THERE AT MY KIDS' SCHOOL
JUST TO LET YOU KNOW
HOW MUCH DO I HAVE TO PAY YOU
I GOT A NEW JOB IN THIS COMPANY
THAT IS IT
IT'S NOT EVERY WEEK
AND IF THEY DON'T EVER SEE IT HOW CAN THEY KNOW
MEETING CONCLUSION
FOR A LONG TIME THEY DIDN'T DO THIS
YOU ALWAYS LOOK FOR THINGS WITH LEISURE
HER PARENTS DID NOT LET HER JOIN THE GROUP
THIS IS A LUXURY SPORTS CAR
BUT ALSO WHILE I WAS GROWING UP
DO YOU REMEMBER WHERE YOU LEFT YOUR BOOK
FREQUENTLY PURCHASE AND READ
MAKING THIS POLICY ONLY ONCE WILL NOT HELP
IT'S ONLY GETTING EXPONENTIALLY WORSE
SHE LIKES WATCHING THAT TRUE CRIME SHOW
YOU'RE GOING TO LEARN HOW TO SHOOT A GUN
I DID NOT CATCH WHAT YOU JUST SAID
YOU SAID SOMETHING ELSE
I'VE HAD HIM PROBABLY FIVE YEARS
THE VIOLENCE THAT WE SEE
MY DAUGHTER MIGHT ENJOY THIS CLASS
MY NURSE IS NOT GOOD
I DO OTHER THINGS VERY WELL
IF YOU DRINK A LOT OF CAFFEINE YOU'LL STAY AWAKE
MY FAMILY IS GOING
LEAVE THE KIDS HERE TODAY
HE WAS VOTED THE SEXIEST ACTOR IN MOVIES
I WENT TO WORK AS AN EDITOR AND WRITER
YOU CAN DO SO MUCH WITH THEM
I'M GLAD THAT WE ARE STARTING TO PAY OUR DEBTS OFF
PLEASE DO NOT BE INVOLVED
THAT IS NOT VERY BAD
I TELL YOU MY FAMILY IS NOT HUNGRY
FOR HAVING HIM OUT THERE
FIRST ONE IS ACTUALLY NOT THAT BAD
THE EQUATION OF THE PARTY
WHO COULD HAVE ENVISIONED THAT
WHAT KIND OF LUXURY WILL YOU HAVE IN THE FUTURE
YOU ARE NOT RIGHT
THEY ARE NOT GOING UP
MY FAMILY IS NOT VERY HUNGRY
THE DEPARTMENT OF INFRASTRUCTURE IS THE ULTIMATE DECISION MAKER
IF THEY WORK AT IT A LITTLE BIT
FOUR WEEKS IS A LOT
I TOTALED THEM ALL UP
THE USUAL LOOKING ONES ARE MINE
EVERYBODY SEEMS TO LIKE THAT
MY KID LOVED THE NEW ROOM WITH THE CITY VIEW
WHAT HAPPENED WITH ALL THE SNOW
HOW DO YOU DO WHAT
ACTUALLY I LIVED THERE
AND MOST PEOPLE LIKE THAT ARE OLD
I HOPE YOU HAVE FAMILY
FIFTY TO A HUNDRED MILES EVERY SUNDAY
THEN THEY OUGHT TO JUST DO IT
PLEASE TELL MY FAMILY I AM COMING
WELL I THINK THAT THIS KIND OF MISSES THE POINT
MY HUSBAND AND I ARE VEGETARIANS
EVEN IN MY OWN EXPERIENCE
MY VOTING EXPERIENCE
IT IS USUALLY NOT HARD TO KNOW WHO YOU ARE
THEY SAY IT IS QUITE EASY
I WOULD HAVE MAYBE CALLED SOONER IF I HAD KNOWN
HERE WE ARE TALKING ON THAT SUBJECT
IT IS TOTALLY RIDICULOUS
ONE OF THESE DAYS WHEN I GET A NEW CAR
THOSE ARE MY KIDS
BUT IT DIDN'T GET THE UPPER PART OF MY BODY
HOW DIFFERENT THE PEOPLE THERE REALLY ARE
I KIND OF MISS OUT ON MOST OF THE CURRENT EVENTS
AND THOSE ARE REALLY HELPFUL
THEN IT GOES THROUGH THE MOON
WE ARE RECYCLING THE NEWSPAPER
DO YOU REMEMBER MAKING THIS DECISION
SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF FUN
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR FRIENDS CANNOT JOIN YOU
I WATCHED SOME FOOTBALL
I DON'T THINK THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH THIS
THE ANTS WOULD START CRAWLING UP YOUR LEGS
INTO A KIND OF A CANDY STICK
THAT GIRL HAD A SMALL STICK WITH HER
DESPERATE TIMES CALL FOR DESPERATE MEASURES
THIS IS MY FAVOURITE CAR
HE SAID SHE CAN'T COME TODAY
I FIND IT VERY SILLY
WE DESTROYED THEM RIGHT THERE
THEY ARE RIGHT OUTSIDE
I'LL CALL AND FIND OUT
BUDGETING AND SOME EXTRA THINGS
I WILL STAY WITH YOU
YOUR VOICE IS VERY NICE
YOU'RE SCORING WELL
THE OTHER TWO ARE SHORT HAIRS
THERE WERE NO CASUALTIES REPORTED
TO CONTINUE IN THAT VEIN
DIDN'T HE HAVE A WOMAN
YOU SHOULD TAKE US WITH YOU
I DO NOT FEEL VERY GOOD
IT WAS LIKE FOUR HUNDRED TIMES AS MUCH
BOTH OF THEM ARE STILL VERY NEW HERE
SOME ODD CHOICES
YOUR BODY'S NOT GOING TO LOOK AS BAD
JUST LISTEN TO YOURSELF
THEY HAVE A SPECIAL SYSTEM TO REPORT THESE THINGS
PLEASE JOIN A DIFFERENT TEAM
WERE YOU ALL TRANSFERRED
IS MY FAMILY COMING OUTSIDE
I AGREE WITH YOU AND THAT IS THE FACT
THAT'S THE KIND THAT PRODUCES THE BEST
LET'S WATCH CHANNEL THIRTEEN NEWS
DO YOU REMEMBER THE NEXT LINE
I ONLY WORK PART TIME
IS MY FAMILY GOOD
IT WAS A GOOD NIGHT OUT ON THE TOWN
THAT IS NOT BAD
COULD YOU MEASURE THIS FOR ME PLEASE
YOU DO THE BEST YOU CAN TO MAKE IT PERFECT
HOW MANY THINGS DO YOU WANT
THEY'RE SAYING NO RIGHT NOW
I HOPE I LOOK LIKE I CAN POINT THEM TO THE RIGHT PLACE
IT'S BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN WORKING THERE FOR A LONG TIME
IT DEPENDS ON WHETHER ONE IS PHYSICAL OR MENTAL
NOT IF THERE IS NO ECONOMIC BENEFIT
HE TRIED TO SEND SOMEONE TO PRISON
I REALLY ENJOYED VISITING DALLAS TEXAS LAST YEAR
BY THE TIME YOU GET A BABY SITTER
IT'S OVER ON THE OTHER END
I GUESS WE DO GET IT FROM PEOPLE TOO
I HAVE IT RIGHT HERE
THAT WHOLE SPACE ISSUE
I THINK AS LONG AS IT'S NOT POISON
I WILL TAKE VERY GOOD CARE OF YOUR HOUSE
THAT'S EASIER DONE IN A COMPANY
I HOPE YOU DO THAT
PLEASE BRING IT HERE
I'VE WORKED IN HOTELS
IT WAS A TOUGH DECISION
I JUST GOT MARRIED LAST YEAR
SPENT A DAY AND A LOT OF MONEY
IT IS NOT GOODBYE
ABOUT THE SAME I DRESS FOR SCHOOL
DID YOU HEAR WHAT YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE GROUP SAID
I THINK THINK SO
I HEARD THAT'S WHAT KILLED THE COMPANY
NOT BAD RIGHT
FULL SCHOLARSHIP
THE STORY WAS A VERY DRAMATIC STORY
DOES IT EVER GO RIGHT
I WOULD LIKE TO GO TO WATCH THAT NEW MOVIE
HOW HAVE WE COME TO THIS POINT
ENJOYABLE TO USE
TALKING IN A BEAT
THEY PROBABLY DO
WHAT WAS THE NAME OF THAT
MANY OTHER RESPONSIBILITIES
THEY FEEL VERY HUNGRY
HE'S IN HIS SIXTIES
I GUESS IF WE GET A NEW CAR WE WILL SELL THE OLD ONE
I ENJOYED IT VERY MUCH
PEOPLE SHOULD REMEMBER THIS
KIND OF GOES ALONG WITH WHAT YOU WERE SAYING
THAT IS NOT AN ACCURATE WAY TO MEASURE TAX RATES
YOU CAN USE THE EDITOR OF YOUR CHOICE
IF ONLY I COULD REMEMBER THE NAME
WE COULD NOT HAVE ONE AS LARGE AS WE HAVE
LET'S GO SOME PLACE FAR AWAY
WEEKEND DUTY HERE
SOMEBODY TRIED TO COME IN VERY EARLY
I HOPE YOU ENJOYED READING THIS BLOG POST
I THINK IT IS PRETTY DARN GOOD
THAT SOUNDS REAL GOOD
HAVE IT CLEAN
I HAD TO LET GO OF THE ILLUSION OF CONTROL
THE ONES THAT WERE MADE A FEW YEARS AGO
THEY GET TAKEN UP AT THE STORE
EVERYBODY HAS A DIFFERENT THING
IT IS ABOUT A TWELVE HOUR DRIVE
WE SEEM TO AGREE
I DO NEED YOU
IT'S VERY TEDIOUS IF YOU DON'T HAVE A WHOLE GROUP
WE DON'T HAVE INSPECTIONS LIKE THAT
BUT WHEN I WENT HOME THAT'S ALL I COULD THINK ABOUT
BEANS LIKE TO BE NEAR CERTAIN TYPES OF PLANTS
WHATEVER MAKES YOU FEEL BETTER
IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE
THEY REALLY ENJOY IT TOO
I'M GLAD IT'S THERE
HAD AN UPSTAIRS APARTMENT
THEY HAVE REALLY SIMPLIFIED THINGS
THE LITTLE ONE IS UP ALREADY
I LOOKED AT MY YARD AND IT HAD WHITE SNOW
WHAT SHE DID WITH THEM DURING THE DAY
THAT IS WHAT I AM AFRAID OF
THAT IS GOODBYE
I WAS AT ONE OF THE BIG HOSPITALS IN NEW YORK
I LIKE TO DO FIELD WORK
SOME OF THE TIME
I AM FREE TO HEAR GOOD MUSIC
THE FINANCIAL PLANNERS
GET AWAY WITHOUT EMBARRASSING YOURSELF
YOU CAN BE A TEACHER WHEN YOU GROW UP
I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING THROUGH ON THAT
NOT MEASURING INFLATION PROPERLY
I THINK THAT'S REAL DANGEROUS
IF THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO DON'T AGREE
THE CHALLENGE OF THE WORK
THIS COUPLE IS GOING HOME NOW
I'M IN THE AUTO PARTS BUSINESS MYSELF
THEY ARE WANTING TO DO ANOTHER
I NEVER DID CARE FOR HIM
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO ROUGH IT TOO MUCH
SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE SO BUSY ANYWAY
WE'LL SEE WHAT WE CAN DO
THIS WAS AN EASY CHOICE FOR ME
IT'LL HELP IN SOME WAY
NURSE IS HERE
THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE DOING
THAT'S THE WAY THEY SUCK YOU IN
I LIVE IN BASICALLY THE SAME DIRECTION AS YOU
DID YOU CATCH THE CHRISTMAS SPIRIT YET
JUST A VISUAL TREAT
I MEAN IT'S NOT GOING TO BE OVERNIGHT
IT'S REALLY HARD TO SAY
PLACE IT JUST A LITTLE TO THE RIGHT
PRETTY MUCH STICK TO A BUDGET
INCLUDING RURAL DISTRICTS
THEY ARE SO YOUNG
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE AN EXPERT TO PLAY THIS GAME
THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE MOST
HE PATTED HIS POCKET AND SAID ONE HUNDRED PERCENT
RED WHITE AND BLUE
AS YOU KNOW WE WILL GO THERE NEXT WEEK
BEEN ON A CRUISE
THEY ARE USED TO THE VIRGINIA AREA
IT HAS BEEN A LONG TIME
HOW ARE WE GOING TO FIX THAT
WE SHOULD GO OVER THIS ONCE AGAIN
WHEN WILL YOU COME HERE
THERE WAS NO STRUCTURE
I COULDN'T MISS THIS GAME AGAIN THIS YEAR
WE'VE GOT FAR TOO MANY
AL CAPONE HAD THREE BROTHERS
DO YOU THINK THAT'S WHAT IT WAS
THIS IS FAR FROM IT
IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYBODY HAS A DOG NOW
I FIGURED THE CHOICE IS MINE
THAT IS THE ONE I WAS THINKING ABOUT
FEMALES IN THE CLASS
PLEASE TELL MY NURSE I AM COMFORTABLE
I HOPE YOU STAY TO EAT WITH US
HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT
THE HOUSES ARE KIND OF SINKING A LITTLE BIT
THEY'RE TRYING TO GET MORE PEOPLE INTO THAT FIELD
MY BABY WILL MISS THIS CLASS TODAY
DO THEY HAVE FAMILY
MIGHT AS WELL BUY ME A NEW CAR FOR THAT
I AM A VISUAL EFFECTS ARTIST
WORKED MOST OF MY LIFE
BECAUSE HER STATEMENT WAS INVALID
IT HAS BEEN QUITE SOME TIME
MY FAMILY IS TALKING TO ME NOW
WHAT DO PEOPLE THINK OF ME
CAN YOU THINK OF A GOOD NAME FOR OUR HOUSE
BUT IT'S SO DARN EXPENSIVE TO GO VISIT THERE
NOT DRAFTING PEOPLE
IS SHE GOING TO STAY HOME
IS THIS A GOOD TIME TO TALK
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS IS REAL
I WON'T SAY I TOLD YOU SO
HOW ABOUT WHEN YOU WERE IN COLORADO
IS SO CAREFUL ABOUT RECYCLING
THEY LIVE IN MISSOURI
I THINK THAT'S THE RIGHT WAY
CAN SOMEONE GO THERE IN A COUPLE OF DAYS
AT FIRST THAT ALWAYS KIND OF BOTHERED ME
DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHAT THIS IS
IT'S UP NORTH
IT'S REAL ENJOYABLE
YOUR WORK IS GETTING BETTER
THE MOST OBVIOUS OCCASION IS THE CELEBRATION OF A NEW HOME
I RELY PRIMARILY ON THE TRAIN TO GET AROUND
I'M TWENTY THREE
FELLOWSHIPS AT OUR CHURCH
LIKE WHEN I LIVED IN WASHINGTON
WE'VE SEEN THIS MANY TIMES BEFORE
IT'S EITHER ME OR THE DOG
POINT BY POINT SUMMARY
IT'S FOR HOMOSEXUALS AND GAYS
IT DEPENDS ON THE PERSON
THE NEIGHBOR ACROSS THE STREET IS NEW
I WAS ABLE TO HELP THE COACH
COLLEGE CREDIT FOR COMMUNITY SERVICE IS A GOOD IDEA
IF SOMEBODY RUINED THEIR LIFE
I FEEL GREAT ABOUT GOING TO THE CITY
IT'S AMAZING
I DON'T MIND COMING BACK LATER
YOU DO NOT NEED FAITH
SO YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF TRAFFIC NOISE REAL CLOSE
YES THAT MIGHT BE THE CASE
I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW TO MEASURE IT
I AM IN FAVOR OF DOING VERY LITTLE CLEAN UP
IT'S AN ASSOCIATION FEE
THE FAST MOVING WATER CARRIED THE DEER AWAY
I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN FULFILLED IF I WORKED THERE
I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH THAT HOLDS TRUE ANYMORE
I THINK IT'S GETTING BETTER
YOU MIGHT ASK WHAT IS THE POINT OF THIS
HERE THAT IS
IT WAS NOT NECESSARILY LOCAL
I AM TALKING TO MY FAMILY
THE CLASS WAS ONLY HALF FULL
WE ARE AMERICAN RESTAURANTS TOO
IT IS LIKE A HUNDRED DEGREES OUTSIDE
THEY ARE VERY IMMATURE
THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP
IT'S JUST TOO HIGH
USUALLY SHE USES HER LEFT HAND
I DON'T FEEL LIKE GOING
THAT'S WHAT YOU DO WITH A CATFISH AFTER YOU CATCH IT
AT ONE POINT I HAD A PET SNAKE
HE AGREED TO BE IN IT
MORE AREAS WHERE THEY WOULD PICK IT UP
SHE USED TO LOVE TO DO STUFF LIKE THAT
IT SEEMS THAT YOU REALLY WANT TO GO
I HAVE A DOG ALSO
I HOPE YOU DO NOT NEED NURSE
I THINK A LOT ABOUT THAT
I FEEL COLD IN THIS HOUSE AT NIGHT
YOU ARE NOT LIKE THAT
THIS MAKES ME LESS SURE ABOUT OUR DECISION
YOU MIGHT WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT
THERE IS A GUY IN DALLAS
THEY ARE AFRAID OF BEING DEPENDENT ON OTHER COUNTRIES
I DO NOT THINK THAT IS VERY SMART
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE HURTING
COLD AIR CAN BE QUITE FUN
I WORK WITH CHILDREN EVERY DAY
THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF BROWN SUGAR IN THE RECIPE
A DECISION IS EXPECTED WITHIN WEEKS
I'VE SEEN IT SEVERAL TIMES
I HAVE FIELD WORK FOR THE NEXT WHOLE MONTH
WE'VE GOT A GOOD VIDEO PLACE OUT HERE
NEVER GONNA LET YOU DOWN
IT SEEMS TO WORK PRETTY WELL SO FAR
THEY DO HAVE
GETTING AWAY WITH THE CARDS IS EASY
HE HELPS ME OUT A LOT AND I GET PAID MONTHLY
AN INVITATION
AND THAT'S ABOUT IT
GROWING UP ON THE FARM
DO YOU SEE THAT HOSPITAL OVER THERE
THIS NEW POLICY WILL NOT APPEAL TO WOMEN
THE METRIC VERSION
I FELT WONDERFUL WITH THIS GROUP
WE PROBABLY NEED TO DO IT AGAIN
YOU KNOW IT WASN'T JUST A SUPER BAD STORM
I'VE HEARD ABOUT THEM
YOU GET A LOT OF SUNFISH
WHAT DO YOU TELL MY NURSE
I WILL THINK ABOUT IT
BOTH OF US CAN STILL MAKE IT IN TIME
WHAT MAKES YOU STAY HERE
WHAT IS GOOD ABOUT THIS JOB
I DON'T HAVE THAT STUFF NOW
THE BASIC IDEA
I THINK IT STARTED ACTUALLY
POUR IN THE RED WINE AND BRING TO A BOIL
I'VE PRESSED THE BUTTON
IT WAS A CORDLESS PHONE
THIS IS MY HOUSE
WE'RE BOTH SCHOOL TEACHERS
I THINK THAT'S THE WAY THIS IS DONE
IT'S JUST AS WELL
I HAVEN'T STARTED MAKING MONEY YET
CAN YOU TELL ME MY PART
SEE A FULL LIST OF CLOSURES HERE
IF THAT'S THE CASE SO BE IT
HE WENT TO THE BATHROOM IN THE PAVILLION
AT LEAST THE BOOK COMES FREE WITH MUSIC
THAT DOES NOT SEEM QUITE FAIR
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF STUFF LIKE THIS
WHEN THEY GET OUT OF SCHOOL
DO YOU KNOW THE COST OF THIS BOOK
YES I AM GOING HERE
WE'RE GOING TO GO VOTE
THANK YOU BOYS FOR BRINGING JOY INTO MY HEART
THERE'S NO PARTICULATES IN NATURAL GAS
THREE DIFFERENT TIMES
THAT WAS A WELL DIRECTED AND ACTED MOVIE
IT WAS ONLY TWO YEARS OLD
FOR MOST IT'S NOT A CHOICE
I LOVE MY HOUSE
I COULDN'T STICK MY CHECK BACK IN THIS BOOK
I AM STILL AROUND IF YOU WANT TO TALK
BASICALLY IT'S A MARKET SURVEY
CALL ME WHEN YOU HAVE SOME TIME
THEY ENCOURAGED PEOPLE TO USE CREDIT CARDS
WE HAVE MACARONI AND CHEESE
I DIDN'T SEE THAT ONE
SHE REACHED UP TO MASSAGE HER TEMPLES
THIS CERTAINLY SEEMS AWFUL TO ME
I HOPE THEY HAVE FAITH
BEEN CUTTING THE TEACHERS SALARIES
THEY TELL YOU
YOU HOPE MY FAMILY IS HERE
I WORE SUITS
DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GOING
PLEASE DO NOT BRING
GOOD LUCK TO YOU THERE IN IDAHO
YOU KNOW SOMETHING MUST BE WRONG
THERE ARE SEVERAL REASONS FOR THE CONFUSION
IT IS UP IN MINNESOTA WHERE I AM NOW
SHE NEEDS TO FIND HERSELF A LAWYER
THAT'S WHAT IT IS HERE TOO
CHANGE THE CHANNEL TO THE NEWS OR SOMETHING
I DON'T THINK ANYONE CARES ABOUT THE FUTURE
BUT IT'S SO LONG
THEY'RE REALLY GOOD CARS
MY MOTHER ALWAYS REPAIRED MY CLOTHES
YOU CAN GIVE ME A CALL ON THIS NUMBER
IT WEIGHS LESS THAN THE LINE
WHAT ELSE WOULD YOU LIKE TO HEAR
MOVING AROUND
A PARTICULAR KIND OF SHOE
WHAT KINDS OF PROFESSIONAL ACTIVITIES DO YOU DO
GO OUT AND TAKE A LUNCH HOUR
I THINK THEY DID A REAL GOOD JOB OF THAT
THIS BRINGS YOU NO END OF JOY
USUALLY HOWEVER THE MOTIVES ARE FAR SIMPLER
THEY WERE MAINLY MY MOTHER'S
IT WAS FUN THOUGH
DO YOU KNOW WHAT WAS HERE BEFORE
IT'S KIND OF PLEASANT
THEY DO HERE
YOU DON'T THINK IT'S ABNORMAL
IF THEY PENALIZE BUSINESSES
THE FIRST GROUP WILL GO AHEAD
I'D PROBABLY GET A THIRD OF A POUND
LET ME ASK YOU THE QUESTION
TENNIS SHOES AND PLAY CLOTHES
THAT WOULD BE TOUGH
I HAVE A NEW IDEA RIGHT NOW
DID YOU LIKE THIS
BRING UP
QUITE A BIT MORE TAXES
IT STARTS HITTING CLOSER TO HOME
NOW I REALLY WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THIS
I'LL HAVE THE SAME
TERRORIST ATTACKS AND NATIONAL SECURITY
IT'S EASY TO TWEAK YOUR VERSION
THAT'S WHAT I WAS DOING BEFORE
WHEN I WAS WORKING AND BEFORE I GOT MARRIED
I THINK THAT'S A LITTLE EXPENSIVE
IT'S HAPPENED SO MANY TIMES
THERE WAS SOME SNICKERING ABOUT IT
A DISH OF SOME KIND
YOU ARE NOT VERY THIRSTY
WORK IN THE NATIONAL PARKS
MY JOB TENDS TO BE VERY DEMANDING
I HOPE I NEVER HAVE TO USE THEM
IT'S THE OTHER WAY AROUND
HOW MUCH CAN HE DO
TELL ME WHAT YOU REALLY THINK
FOR A RIFLE THERE'S NO WAITING
HAVE FUN ON YOUR DAY OFF
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO IF I CAN'T AFFORD IT
I'M IN THE SPEECH PROCESSING BUSINESS
I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU
IF I AM LOOKING FOR ENTERTAINMENT USUALLY I GO OUT
THEY REALLY GOT SOMETHING GOING THIS YEAR
IT'S A NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE MODEL
LET'S TAKE HIM HOME
I'M DOING MY MASTERS
ALL THIS EVIDENCE BRINGS US TO ONE CONCLUSION
HE GETS RIGHT INTO IT
THAT FERTILIZER POLLUTES THE GROUNDWATER
THAT SHOULD JUST SIMPLY BE TAKEN OUT OF THE HOMES
THAT'S CERTAINLY TRUE
TO STAY HOME AND RAISE YOUR FAMILY IS HARD WORK
ELIGIBLE FOR A FINE
THE FURTHER AWAY I GET FROM HOME THE HAPPIER I AM
THAT WAS ALL THAT WAS THERE
IT'S ON WHEELS AND IT'S BIG
DOES HE WORK FOR A COMPANY DOWN THERE
I STILL LIVE IN SAN JOSE
I REMEMBER SEEING THAT
ANALYTICS AND VISUALIZATION
PEOPLE HAVE SEEN BETTER TIMES
WE'RE JUST STEALING IT
I ONCE WENT OUT WITH A BOY IN MY HIGH SCHOOL
THAT'S KIND OF NICE
IT LOSES IT SOMEWHERE
YOUR VOTE WILL DECIDE THE FUTURE
I SUGGESTED TO HIM
WHY DON'T YOU STAY WITH US FOR THE DAY
LIKE A LIGHT COUGH
I WOULD LIKE TO JUST SIT HERE AND EAT
I SUPPOSE THAT IS A VALUABLE SERVICE
I'M KIND OF MIXED ON IT
THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN WHAT IT WAS
IF YOU HAVE ANY DOUBTS WHATSOEVER
PICK A COMPANY THAT YOU ARE INTERESTED IN
HAVE YOU EVER PLAYED BASEBALL
BEING KILLED OFF BY THE THOUSANDS
WE KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT DECISION
THE INSIDES OF THE DOOR PANELS
THIS SYSTEM WORKS VERY WELL FOR US
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE EVER HEARD OF IT
THAT'S WHAT I WANT
I THINK THOSE GUYS SHOULD BE DONE AWAY WITH
THAT MAY BE OUR ONLY ANSWER
AREN'T YOU PLANNING TO HAVE CHILDREN
IT IS A PRETTY LARGE CHURCH
HOW MANY MILES DID YOU RUN
WE HAVE A SOCCER TEAM THAT COMES AND GOES
WHICH FIELD DO YOU WORK IN
AND YOU REALLY BEGIN TO DEVELOP AN INTEREST IN IT
DATA ENTRY STUFF
MY WIFE AND I BOTH LIKE IT
NOTHING SEEMS EASIER THAN WATCHING TELEVISION
FORMS FOR HIS PHOTOGRAPHY BUSINESS
THE BUILDING STARTED SHAKING WHEN THE EARTHQUAKE HIT
MY HEART IS NOT IN CAMPING
TELL MY FAMILY THEY ARE HUNGRY
VERY RIGHT
HOW DO YOUR EMPLOYEES DEAL WITH THIS
IT'S NICE THAT THERE'S A CHOICE
THE FIRST APPEAL IS AUTOMATIC
MY NEW SHOES WILL LAST ME LONGER THAN THAT
YOU MUST GO THROUGH THERE FIRST
RATHER QUICK VICTORY
WHY NOT HAVE THE WHOLE SERVICE
IT WAS MY PLEASURE THANK YOU FOR REACHING OUT
THREE WEEKS AFTER SCHOOL STARTED
IT IS UNUSUAL FOR HER TO WALK AWAY
THEY DO NOT HAVE MY MUSIC
SO I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT
YOU STUDIED ART IN YOUR PROGRAM
I HAVE A THIRTEEN HUNDRED DOLLAR BID
THEY LIVE JUST OUTSIDE TEXAS
THE FUNNINESS OF THE GAG
OR IS IT ALL FUNDED OUT OF LOCAL TAXES
I LEAN TO THAT COVERAGE
SO WHICH LITTLE VOICE IS YOUR FAVORITE
I FELT LIKE WE ROUGHED IT
I MEAN TO ME IT IS
THERE MAY HAVE BEEN A PROBLEM
I REALLY DON'T WANT TO SEE THEM GO
DO YOU WANT SOME COMPANY
WE GREW UP IN THE SOUTH
YOU SHOULD MAKE A DIFFERENT CHOICE
THEY HAD IT EVERYWHERE
NOBODY WOULD WANT ME ON THEIR TEAM
THIS USED CAR HAS IT
I WOULD RATHER WAIT FOR A MONTH
MY MOTHER ALWAYS BRINGS HER TELEVISION WITH HER
I KNOW I HAVE TO DO MORE AEROBICS
I THOUGHT THAT WAS REALLY FUNNY
CLEAN UP HERE PLEASE
THE PLAYERS ARE PRETTY UNFOCUSED AT THIS POINT
I THINK I AM GETTING A CALL COMING IN
I HOPE YOU WILL COME HOME SOON
MUSIC PLEASE
THAT'S WHAT WE ARE SEARCHING FOR
IN THE RIVERS AND STUFF
WHAT WOULD YOU MAKE
MAYBE NOT THAT LONG AGO
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
GOODBYE GOODBYE
ALL FOUR TEAMS HAVE GENERATIONALLY GREAT POINT GUARDS
I CAN'T CARE LESS ABOUT THIS
AT THIS POINT WE'VE RIPPED ON EVERYONE
THAT'S A NICE CAR
I'VE ALSO DRIVEN ONE AT A TRACK EVENT
SHE MUST REALLY LIKE THEM
I ENJOY BOTH WATCHING SOCCER AND PLAYING IT
AND I WAS SITTING THERE
HE DIDN'T MAKE IT
ANY SPORTS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
I THINK I'M GOING TO LOOK FOR THAT
THEY WOULD BE PRETTY ELABORATE
GO ONE WAY OR THE OTHER
I DON'T SEE MUCH TV MOSTLY WHEN I'M IN SCHOOL
THIS IS AN INTERESTING CHOICE
NOW I HAS THE RANDOM TESTING POLICY
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU
I AM LIVING IN THAT DORM
HOW ARE YOU COMING HERE
PURSUE ANYTHING MORE THAN YOUR NURSING DEGREE
I ALMOST THINK THERE'S SOME POLITICS AROUND HERE
I WAS MOSTLY INTERESTED IN THE BASEBALL STUFF
THE COLLEGE RANKS
I HEARD THE OPPOSITE
YOUR VOICE SOUNDS GREAT TODAY
IT REALLY IS AND WE'RE ALL HEADING THAT WAY
THE CREEK WAS JUST WILD
HOW MUCH MONEY DID YOU SPEND ON COLLEGE
THIS POLICY WILL GIVE MORE POWER TO OTHERS
I CAN HEAR YOUR VOICE FROM HERE
IT DOESN'T SOUND NECESSARY IN TEXAS
I LOVE THE WATER AEROBICS
GOD WILL TAKE CARE OF US WHEN IT'S OUR TIME
I MEAN THAT'S WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO THINK
IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE AVOIDED
YOU GOT SOME LAKES AROUND YOU CAN DO THAT
THAT TEXAS TWANG OR WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT
DO WE THINK THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD FINANCE IT
YOU KNOW IT'S BOUND TO SPREAD
YOU HAVE A SEPARATE ACCOUNT FOR THAT
STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOUSE
SHE SMILED COYLY AT THE TWO OF THEM
YOU HAVE IT GOOD
I DON'T REMEMBER THIS FROM LAST YEAR
WHAT DID YOU WANT TO SHOW ME
DO WITHOUT TOO MUCH
THIS HOUSE HAS A NICE CITY VIEW
MAYBE WE DO HAVE A CHOICE
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH THE SOUTH END OF THE STATE
DID YOU CHECK THIS YOURSELF
THE WHOLE ELECTRONIC CLASSROOM IDEA
WHEN YOU WERE PREGNANT
HE ATE A PIECE OF THE PIE
I BELIEVE I GET TWENTY POINTS FOR THIS
THAT IS NOT OKAY
EVERYONE MOSTLY LOVED THE SPACE
IT WILL BE EASY IF WE DO IT TOGETHER
MY DAUGHTER IS FOUR YEARS OLD
I KEPT WAITING FOR SOMETHING UNUSUAL TO HAPPEN
WE JUST MOVED INTO THIS HOUSE
HE WENT TO MOVE IN WITH ANOTHER GIRL
AMERICAN TEAMS WILL FALL BACK THIS SEASON
YES I FEEL GOOD
THEY ARE VERY KIND TO ME
GROUND INVASION
THIS IS LIKE JUDO ON STEROIDS
LOCAL PEOPLE WILL HELP YOU
MEMBER OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
I BELIEVE WE HAVE TO GO TO WORK NOW
THEY GIVE A LOT MORE LEAVE
I HAVE SEEN THAT HAPPEN LOTS OF TIMES
I DON'T KNOW HOW HARD IT IS
I LIKE LIGHT AND WHITE CLOTHES
THAT IS BETTER GET MY HEAD IN THE RIGHT POSITION
THAT WOMAN LOOKED OVER MY HEAD THE WHOLE TIME
WE PLANTED THOSE OUT BY THE SEPTIC TANK
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME
I JUST HAVE A REAL HARD TIME DOING THAT
I HAVE HEARD QUOTES
NOTHING ELSE IS COMPARABLE
MANY PEOPLE WILL COME FOR THIS
RESIDENTIAL SITUATIONS
I HOPE I'M ON THE RIGHT TRACK
YOU HOPE YOU HAVE MY FAITH
ONE'S IN COLLEGE ALREADY
I HAVE TWO KITTENS AT HOME
I CAN'T EVEN THINK OF WHAT IT IS
THERE'S A LOT TO DO THIS WEEK
AN ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY
I REALLY LIKE THAT SHOW
THIS IS OUR NEW COMPANY POLICY
SHE STILL PLAYS THE PIANO AND SHE IS IN A BAND
THEY'RE KIND OF NICE
REHABILITATE YOU
SHE IS TO THIS DAY
YES MY FAMILY IS GOING HERE
WE DO A LOT OF THINGS ON THE WEEKENDS TOGETHER
I'D LIKE TO GO BIRD HUNTING
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT IT
HELPING ELDERLY PEOPLE
TWENTY SOMETHING
I GUESS SHE WANTED A PRIVATE LIFE
GO AND ACTUALLY LIVE IN THAT COUNTRY FOR A WHILE
OR YOUR CHILD ACCIDENTLY DID
IT IS THE OWNER'S RESPONSIBILITY
YOU CAN KIND OF RELATE TO IT YOU KNOW
THEY DON'T HAVE THE WHEREWITHAL TO DO IT THEMSELVES
WE PLAN TO CLEAN THE WHOLE HOUSE THIS WEEKEND
LOWER DIVISION PLAYER OF THE TOURNAMENT
ALL THE SERVICES ARE CHARGING MORE MONEY
YES MY FAMILY IS GOING UP
I DO AGREE WITH YOU
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUT THEY DID ANYWAY
WE THOUGHT YOU MIGHT ENJOY IT
TRUMP WAS RIGHT TO POINT THAT OUT
I DON'T WANT TO CARRY MONEY AROUND
I THINK YOUR CHOICE IS RIGHT
I LIKE MUSIC
THEY SHOULD STUDY THIS NEW SPECIES
GET THE RECIPE FROM THEM
THE DETROIT LIONS
I HEAR MINE SAYING NO
WE WOULD WANT TO INVEST
SO IT ALL COMES FILTERING DOWN TO US ALL
BUT WHEN I DO IT USUALLY BRINGS ME JOY
THERE'S NO HOCKEY
I COULDN'T WAIT FOR ONE WHOLE MONTH TO CHECK
WHY ARE VISION BLOCKERS NOT USED ON LARGER AREAS
THEY GIVE EACH CANDIDATE FIVE MINUTES
DO NOT USE VISUAL AIDS MERELY AS TOOLS
FOUR SUPER BOWLS
MY HUSBAND LOVES THIS MUSIC
YOU ARE PROBABLY RIGHT
THEY NEED IT RIGHT HERE
WE WERE FROM THE NORTH
WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO
MY WIFE AND I BOTH DID
THE MISSION WILL DRAW THE CORRESPONDING CONCLUSIONS
DON'T FIGHT AGAINST A POWER COMPANY
TAKING MEASURES TO EXTEND YOUR LIFE FURTHER IS EASY
IN SAN ANTONIO IT WAS LIKE EVERY DAY
I DON'T KNOW IT'S MAYBE FIVE PERCENT
THEY HAVE TO ADHERE TO THAT INDUSTRY STANDARD
IN MY VIEW THIS GUY WILL MISS THE GAME
I VISITED ONCE OR TWICE
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU DO WITH THEM AT THIS POINT
RIGHT AT THE RIGHT TIME OF THE YEAR
I HOPE YOU ENJOYED THE TUTORIAL SO FAR
THOSE THINGS GO FAST AROUND HERE
CHANGING PEOPLE'S EXPECTATIONS
MAYBE PUT IN A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT
THE DAY CARE ACCEPTED INFANTS STARTING AT SIX WEEKS OLD
WE DIDN'T HAVE ANYONE IN TOWN THAT WAS OUR FAMILY
THE LUXURY RETAILERS
WE WERE GOING TO BE METRIC
TRYING TO GET OUT OF WHEREVER THEY ARE
THE DECISION HAS BEEN MADE THAT A CHANGE IS NOW NECESSARY
DOES THIS COURSE INTEREST YOU
HOW CAN I MAKE MY VOICE HEARD
AND HIS EMPLOYEES AGREE
I THINK I HAVE SEEN THIS BEFORE
FORTY FIVE DOLLARS A YEAR
MY PARENTS WOULDN'T VOTE IN THE FUTURE
THAT GIVES US SPECIAL TIME TOGETHER TOO
THE CIVILIAN CASUALTIES WOULD BE STAGGERING
THEY'RE NOT REALLY CABINS
MY COWORKER IS VERY ANNOYING
CREATE A SPORTS DIVISION
I WILL PICK YOU UP AFTER WORK
I LIKE THAT HERE
I HAVE ENOUGH OF THAT IN MY OWN LIFE
I THINK THE CATHOLIC RELIGION ITSELF IS FINE
AN AMERICAN GROCERY STORE NOW
I KNOW THE DAY CARE CENTERS ARE NOT CHEAP EITHER
RAISING CHILDREN TODAY IS DIFFERENT THOUGH
HUNTER SAFETY PROGRAM
IT'S NOT THAT BIG OF A THING THIS YEAR
IT HAS REALLY BEEN NICE HERE THIS WINTER
HELLO I AM LIKE YOU
YOUR CHOICE
HE SAID WHAT DID YOU GET A DEAL FOR
NURSE IS NOT BAD HAVE FAITH
SOMEONE LEFT THIS HERE FOR YOU
WHAT ARE YOU LEARNING TO BE
SYSTEM BENEFITS ONLY SOME PEOPLE HERE
THE CAR'S ENGINE IS IN EXCELLENT SHAPE
THIS PIECE IS OBVIOUSLY EXPENSIVE
SOMEBODY WILL POINT IT OUT SOON ENOUGH
I WAS THRILLED TO DEATH
I BELIEVE IN CAPITAL PUNISHMENT
IT KIND OF FELT LIKE HE DIDN'T CARE
I ENJOY WHEN THEY COME OVER
IT DOESN'T STAY GREEN
BUT THE POINT WAS APPARENT
SO I FIGURED IT WASN'T TRUE
I THINK THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING
WE'D GO TO THE LIBRARY AND DO THINGS LIKE THAT
MY FAITH IS GOOD
I'VE GOTTEN INTO A FEW SCRAPS
IT'S FUNNY HOW MANY NAMES HAVE BEEN USED
I FELT THAT WE ALWAYS SPEND LESS TIME ON THIS TOPIC
I LIKE TO SIT DOWN AND READ MAGAZINES
WE DON'T GET ANY SNOW HERE ANYMORE
THIS WOMAN JUST OFFERED IT TO ME
THIS WILL BE THE DEATH OF NEWSPAPER
HELP HERE I AM TIRED
ENJOY WHENEVER YOU DESIRE
AND WE WENT OUT TO DINNER WITH SOME FRIENDS
IT'S A CONCERT BAND
THEY ADOPTED THE DEATH PENALTY AGAIN
LOT OF CONCRETE AND GLASS
THAT THEY OUGHT TO
REGULAR NORMAL TAXPAYERS
EVEN THOUGH I WASN'T SPENDING MUCH MONEY
KIDS COULD SEE THEIR PARENTS MORE FREQUENTLY
AND WE HAVE THREE PLAYING BASEBALL
BEING ABLE TO TELL OLD STORIES
SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF MONEY
WE LOVE TO STAY IN THE COUNTRY
SHE TOOK OFF HER GLASSES AND MASSAGED HER TEMPLES
HOW MUCH TIME DO YOU HAVE FOR ME
THE COMPANY WILL VOTE HIM OUT
SELF DETERMINATION
IT'S NOT A HATCHBACK
I THINK WE FULFILLED OUR OBLIGATION
BOOKS ABOUT FREUD AND PSYCHOANALYSIS
JUST KIND OF ROUGHED IT
IT'S A LOT EASIER THEN
THAT WAS BEFORE I MOVED OUT HERE
DID I MISS ANY IMPORTANT POINTS
IF HE GOT IN TROUBLE
YEAH THAT'S AN IDEA
SOME WINE TASTINGS UP IN THE VALLEY
ARE YOU HAVING ANY TROUBLE WITH BUGS IN YOUR GARDEN
BUT I GUESS PEOPLE DO THAT WHEN THEY'RE DESPERATE
MY HOUSE IN THE CITY IS OLD BUT BIG
I'M SURE YOU'D FIND SOMETHING
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
HAS HE HAD THIS SINCE KINDERGARTEN
MY MOM TAUGHT ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE
IT WAS HIS DECISION AND YOU HAVE TO RESPECT IT
I DID IT WITH LOT OF DIFFICULTY
SOMEONE SHOULD GIVE YOU SOMETHING TO EAT
IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S COMING OUT OF JOINT MONEY
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING
THIS IS THE VISION THAT WE HAVE
THEY DON'T KNOW THAT I DON'T USE DRUGS
NOW WE GET CHANNEL FIFTY FIVE
I PURCHASED SOME MAGAZINES
WHEN DO YOU WANT THE BABYSITTER TO COME
I HOPE YOU ARE OKAY
WE LOVE EATING FRESH VEGETABLES IN THE SUMMER
I DO NOT HAVE HOPE
THEY DO NOT HAVE IT
I DON'T KNOW THAT SPENDING MORE ALWAYS GETS IT
OR MAYBE FOR TWENTY DOLLARS
MAYBE WE SHOULD MOVE TO THE SOUTH
I JUST GOT BACK FROM DAYTON
THERE'S RATS LIVING IN THE ATTIC
WOMEN CAN BE AT DIFFERENT POINTS IN THEIR LIFE
AM I PLUGGED IN TO MY FEEDING TUBE AND OF MY BAG ARE YOU ABLE TO DO THAT
THE TRIAL IS OVER
I'M KIND OF LEARNING THIS AS I GO
I WENT SKIING
MY FAMILY IS TIRED
BECAUSE HE WAS CARRYING A CAMERA
SHE BOUGHT A NEW LIGHT WEIGHT SKIRT
ALSO SWIMS IN COLLEGE
I WOULD LIKE TO DO THAT AS A FRIEND
THAT WAS A LIFESAVER
WE BOUGHT A LOT OF CASSETTE TAPES
THEY THINK IT'S KIND OF COOL
GETTING TO AGREE TO THINGS IS THE GOAL
THEY WILL BE MARRIED IN A MONTH
I DON'T CARRY CASH AROUND
WHERE ARE YOU
IT IS THAT GOOD
I COULDN'T REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS
DO YOU HAVE A WOK THOUGH
I THINK SOME PEOPLE HAVE JUST ASSED
PLEASE TELL MY NURSE I AM HUNGRY
I HOPE YOU LIKE MY MUSIC
I AM A CONVERTED CATHOLIC
I HAVE TO WALK TO THE STORE TO PICK UP SOME FOOD
THEY ARE SO SMALL
WHY DON'T YOU GO AHEAD AND START
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT
I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT I AM AFRAID
I WANT TO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY
WE PAY FAR TOO MUCH FOR WHAT WE GET
THE COMPARISON IS ALMOST EXPECTED AT THIS POINT
I ENJOY GARDENING
IT WAS BONELESS AND WE TRIED IT
WELL I ORIGINALLY COME FROM NEW YORK
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN
THAT HAS GOT TO BE BLOOMING THIS TIME OF YEAR
WE MOVED INTO THE APARTMENT AND GOT CABLE
PLEASE GIVE US FIFTEEN MORE MINUTES
AT THE END OF SEASONS
GIVE ME SOME TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT
I WILL CERTAINLY DO THIS AGAIN
I WON'T TELL YOU THAT
WHO ELSE KNEW ABOUT THIS
I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER THIS BEING ON THERE
AND ANOTHER CHILD THAT THEY HAD ALREADY MET
WHAT ARE THOSE
CLEAN UP IT
NO MUSIC CLOSER
I CAN DO ENOUGH DAMAGE WITH THOSE TWO
I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT
WE TOOK ANOTHER FRIEND WITH US
YOU ARE NOT VERY TIRED
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE
THAT IS A VERY NICE CAR
MAYBE AFTER WE'RE NOT IN SCHOOL ANYMORE
SOME OF THEM ARE OUR PROBLEMS
I NEED TO BE THERE
I DIDN'T REALIZE
THE CITY IS NOT THAT FAR FROM HERE
MOST PEOPLE DON'T
THE OYSTER BARS DOWN THERE
HE DOESN'T REALLY ENJOY DOING IT
DO YOU HAVE RECYCLING
EVEN AT A GROUP RATE
NEVER GONNA SAY GOODBYE
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS RESEARCH
THEY HAVE A LOT OF THEM THERE AT THE CLUB
TO DONATE BASICALLY THEIR TIME AND EFFORTS
NEVER EVER GIVE AWAY YOUR TIME LIKE THAT
WE HOPE THAT IT WILL BE
YOU WEAR A JACKET
BECAUSE IT'S INDUSTRY
I DO NOT DO THAT
DO YOU LIKE CLASSICAL
I TYPICALLY AM NOT A CAT PERSON
I WILL PAY FOR HALF OF THE BUDGET
I HOPE THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED
THAT IS OKAY
THEY HAVE NO FAITH
TAKE IT TO A LOGICAL EXTREME
HOW DO YOU HAVE SO MANY NEW IDEAS
I DON'T BUY THE NEWSPAPER
MY SISTERS BOTH SEEM TO LIKE IT PRETTY WELL
SHE STOPPED DOING IT
ARE THEY RIGHT
I AM VERY MUCH FOR CAPITAL PUNISHMENT
I DO NOT CLEAN IT UP
I OWN LESS STUFF THAN YOU
ONE DAY WE'LL BE ABLE TO DO IT
THE HOMEOWNER CAN'T BE TOUCHED
THIS COUPLE IS KNOWN TO COOK GOOD FOOD
FOUR OR FIVE MONTHS AGO
THE POINT I AM MAKING IS THAT MONEY IS NOT EVERYTHING
WE RENTED A CAR AND DROVE PRETTY MUCH EVERYWHERE
HOW DO YOU USUALLY EAT IT
LET'S TAKE A QUICK WALK
WE HAVE TO GET RID OF THEM ALL
I HAVE AN HOUR LEFT UNTIL I LEAVE
DO IT
A PART OF THE SYSTEM
THEY USED THEM IN THE WAR IN AFGHANISTAN
I HOPE EVERYTHING WORKS OUT UP THERE
INTEREST ON MY CREDIT CARD IS QUITE HIGH
I WILL SET THE FOOD HERE
THIS IS A GREAT WAY TO TRY DIFFERENT THINGS
I KNEW IT WAS EASIER BACK HERE
PASSING THAT ON TO EACH OTHER
A POINT OF VIEW
I'VE HAD THAT HAPPEN
DO YOU USUALLY PLACE THIS ON THE SIDE
MULTIPLE VERSIONS
THAT'S WHAT I SAID
THEY DIDN'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM BACK THEN
AND SHE STARTS HER OWN STUFF FROM SEED NOW
HOW MANY BEDROOMS IS IT
A FLOCK OF BIRDS WAS CIRCLING IT
I'M HOPING THEY'LL HAVE SOME KIND OF MEDICINE
WE SHOULD PROBABLY SEE THIS AT THE END
PLEASE BRING HOPE
I THINK YOU OWE THE FAMILY A RESPONSIBILITY
YOU SOUND SO YOUNG
MY CITY IS FULL OF INTERESTING PEOPLE
ARE YOU AROUND THE HOUSE
WHO TOLD YOU THAT
WATCH AND THEN RECORD OVER IT
IT'S THE CULTURE IN ASIA
HE IS A POWER USER
AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE
SOMETIMES IT IS THE SAME PEOPLE
I WENT BACK TO SCHOOL AND GOT MY MASTER'S DEGREE
HOPE THEY FEEL OKAY
DO YOU HAVE SUCCESS
I HAVE GOT ABOUT TWELVE TICKETS COMING IN THE MAIL NEXT WEEK
WHO WAS RAISED BY CHRISTIAN PARENTS
THEY HOPE THEY HAVE MY FAITH
I GUESS IT DEPENDS ON WHO YOU TALK TO
I'M KIND OF THE OPPOSITE
YOU COULD READ WELL AT FIVE YEARS OLD
COMPUTER IS NOT OKAY
SHE WENT TO FIND HIM JUST A WHILE AGO
I HAVE ENOUGH MONEY FOR MY COLLEGE
I HOPE MY NURSE IS COMFORTABLE
NO PROBLEM THERE AT ALL
HEAT OIL IN A MEDIUM PAN OVER MEDIUM HIGH HEAT
WE DEFINITELY NEED A CHANGE IN THE SYSTEM
HE KNEW HE WAS GONNA BE THE WHIPPING BOY AGAIN
IT JUST KIND OF DRAGGED ON FOREVER
BUT NOT AS MUCH AS WE SHOULD
HE GOT OFF RIGHT AWAY
THAT'S PROBABLY A GOOD IDEA
THAT IS THE BIGGEST CAT I HAVE EVER SEEN
THEY WILL TAKE DOWN MANY GREAT MOVIES ANY DAY NOW
I GUESS OUR TOPIC IS ABOUT MOVIES
BUT WE DON'T LIKE TO DO THAT AT ALL
I LIKE MY NURSE
CLEAN HERE
CHOOSING THE RIGHT LUXURY VEHICLE FOR YOU
YOU JUST HAVE TO TRY IT OUT
TELL MY FAMILY I DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE
AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE
THEY HAVE TO BE IN CHARGE
THEY ALSO HAVE SALES TAXES
WHEN DID THE SEXUAL DIVISION OF LABOR BEGIN
SHE IS EIGHTY NINE YEARS OLD
DO YOU WANT TO EAT INSIDE OR OUTSIDE
SOMETIMES IT GETS TO BE EXCESSIVE
DON'T GO BACK IN THERE
SOME PEOPLE GREW UP WITH GUNS IN THE HOUSE
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM
I HAVEN'T TESTED THE BRAKES YET
PLEASE RECORD EVERYTHING YOU SEE HERE
VERY WELL PERSUADED
I AM NOT EXERCISING ALL THE TIME
WHAT GOOD IS THAT
THAT'S MY BOY YOU MADE MY DAY
I STOCK THE SAME PART
IS IT OKAY
I DIDN'T EVEN REALLY THINK ABOUT IT THAT MUCH
OUR FINANCIAL SITUATIONS ARE DIRE
TELL MY NURSE YOU DO NOT FEEL THIRSTY
CLEAN UP HERE
WHAT IS YOUR MAJOR IN THE NEW COLLEGE
GOOD TO REMEMBER
THAT WOMAN KNOWS THAT THIS FACT IS TRUE
BRING THAT PAID TAX REPORT
A WOMAN PROSECUTOR THERE WAS MURDERED
THAT'S VERY SPICY
MILES PER HOUR TO KILOMETERS PER HOUR
YES I AM TIRED
IT WOULD BE KIND OF FUN
I FEEL BAD HERE
EVERYTHING I KNOW ABOUT THIS IS WHAT I READ LAST WEEK
IS THAT IT YOU
IT'S JUST A LOT OF FUN
THIS LOOKS VERY NEAT
PRICE POINT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO CUSTOMERS
YOU WERE LATE TO PICK FOOD UP
SO MUCH ABOUT THAT MOVIE
SCHOOL WAS CERTAINLY VALUED
THANK YOU SO MUCH
WE ALL NEED A CHANGE FOR A FEW DAYS
SO THIS IS JUST A STARTING POINT
OR IF YOU HAVEN'T SOLD PROPERTY
THE WIND WAS FAVORING THE AWAY TEAM
WHAT ELSE DO YOU THINK IS IN STORE FOR US
EVERY PERSON HERE IS LOOKING AT US
THEY GET MAD AT THEMSELVES WHEN THEY DON'T DO WELL
I WAS UP THERE LAST WEEKEND
DO YOU FEEL THAT
I REALLY HATE SERVICE JOBS
SELLING OUT YOUR COUNTRY
THE STORE IS SEVEN MILES AWAY
I LIKE TO MOW THE LAWN
WE NEED TO GIVE CLOSURE TO THE FAMILIES
ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO
WE WILL TALK ABOUT BUDGET IN THE CLASS
A GOOD MIX OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE SAME INTERESTS
YOU WANT IT TO STAY AS GOOD AS IT POSSIBLY CAN BE
WE DIDN'T EVEN CALL THEM
IT WENT THE OTHER WAY
I AM VERY HUNGRY
WE HAVE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT MUSIC
WE HAD A DOG BEFORE WE MOVED HERE
I THINK THE GHOST IS IN THE HOUSE
A LOT OF OTHER COMPANIES WILL
YOU TALKED ABOUT SOMETHING
BASICALLY THE SIZE OF KANSAS
WE'RE TOWARD THE BOTTOM
IT'S AN ABSOLUTE SAVINGS
HE WOULD LIKE TO VISIT ALL THOSE PLACES AGAIN
PRETTY ROUGH THING TO BE
DO I HAVE SUCCESS
TESTING ON THE GROUND ITSELF AT THAT POINT
FROM WHAT I CAN TELL
LET PAST BE IN THE PAST
THEY HAVE TO JUST GO THROUGH EVERYTHING
TAX SEASON IS COMING SOON FOR THE COMPANIES
THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE SOME KIND OF NOTE
ARE YOU PUTTING TOO MANY IN
THEIR WAY OF LIFE CHANGED
THAT WAS ALL WE EVER SAW
YOU DON'T NEED TO DRAG IT DOWN THE HALL
ALSO THEY GET BETTER QUALITY CARE
I GREW UP IN THIS SMALL COUNTRY
WELL I GUESS THIS IS IT
I GUESS I ENJOY MY WALK TO WORK
I'VE JUST BEEN CALLED
MY DAUGHTERS BOTH HAVE PET HAMSTERS
IT HELPS YOU HANG ONTO YOUR ROOTS
HOW ARE THEY
DALLAS HAS A GUY
AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THAT
THE GRACE PUSHES YOU BEYOND THE LAW
A SALESPERSON WILL USUALLY WANT TO KNOW
THEY HAD SIXTY FOUR OF THEM
IT IS VITAL THAT YOU MEASURE YOUR BODY CORRECTLY
WE MOVED TO THIS CITY LAST YEAR
THEY HAVE NO CHILDREN IN SCHOOL
THAT'S THE NEW ONE
THIS LUXURY HOUSE IS GREAT
PEOPLE ARE CRAZY
WHAT IS THE MOST ENJOYABLE PART OF YOUR JOB
WHERE DO YOU GO TO COLLEGE
I THINK IT PROMOTES GOOD FAMILY VALUES
THAT IS KIND OF WILD
I HOPE YOU'LL FIND HIM
THIS WILL BE A NEW GOVERNMENT POLICY
THEY ARE NOT COMING
IT'S OVER BY THE FAR EDGE
MY SUCCESS IS CLOSER
I NEVER HAD EITHER
I STILL HAVEN'T MADE A DECISION
BECAUSE YOU PUT SUCH A COMMITMENT ON EDUCATION
I'LL SLICE WHITE GRAPE
WE HOPE YOU ENJOY YOUR STAY
YES SHE LIKES TO WATCH FOOTBALL
IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE LETS DO IT AGAIN
THE TESTING WENT A LITTLE BIT TOO FAR
I WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TO ARRIVE
THIS IS PROBABLY TYPICAL THOUGH
THERE'S A LOT OF CRIME
STATE LAND GRANT COLLEGES
BUT NOW I REALIZE THAT IT WAS BETTER
YOU KNOW IN THE INTEREST OF FULL DISCLOSURE
I LIKE TO EAT CHEESES AND FRUITS AND VEGETABLES
I HAVE HEARD THAT'S REAL GOOD
YOU MADE SURE THAT THEY WERE CARED FOR
WE HAD ONE OF THE FINANCIAL COMPANIES CALL US
I DO SOME SEWING
LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS FIRST
THROUGH TELEVISION
THAT'S NICE OVER THERE
THEY HAVE A SET PERIOD OF TIME
MEASURING IT IS NOT AN EXACT SCIENCE
PORK LOIN IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS TO GRILL
IT'S REALLY MORE OF A TOY
THE OTHER THING I CAN THINK OF
WE SHOULD START THIS PAPER EARLY
THEY NEED TO MAKE A LIVING
IT'S REAL PRETTY
HOPE YOU ALL ENJOY
MY DAD'S GOT A NEW BIKE
THEY WERE THROWN FORWARD
DO YOU STILL KEEP UP WITH THEM
DO YOU EVER WATCH CHEERS
THIS SORT OF THING IS NEVER GOOD
I REALLY LOVED IT
I DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW TO RESOLVE THIS
THAT WAS PRETTY UPSETTING FOR HER
I CAN'T REALLY REMEMBER WHAT IT IS
THE RECESSION IS DRAGGING ON AND ON
NEEDS AND WANTS AREN'T NECESSARILY THE SAME THING
I AM NOT VERY HUNGRY
I AM NOT THAT TYPE OF INDIVIDUAL
SURE I WILL GIVE IT TO HER WHEN I SEE HER NEXT
PEOPLE WERE JUMPING TO THE WRONG CONCLUSION
NURSES GET SO WORN DOWN
NOW IT'S COMING BACK INTO FAVOR
SOMEPLACE FOR THE CHILDREN TO BE
AFTER HE EARNED THAT MERIT BADGE
I STILL GO TO RIGHT BACK TO WHAT I SAID
I AM CLEAN
THEY NEED IT OUTSIDE
HOW ABOUT IN YOUR CASE
THE CREEK OVERFLOWED AFTER THE STORM CAME THROUGH
LOCAL PEOPLE WILL SELL THIS FOR LESS
OR EVALUATE A PERSON BY THAT
I REALLY WOULD BE AT A LOSS
MOST RAP I DON'T LIKE
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE LEFT IT THERE
GO SLOWER
SOME OF THE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN
DO YOU LIKE MY MUSIC
SEWING AND QUILTING
WHY DO YOU WANT TO DESTROY ME
WELL THAT'S THE WAY MINE IS
THE BOY'S NAME HAS NOT BEEN RELEASED
HAVE YOU EVER CAMPED ON SAND
ALWAYS GOT A PLACE FOR YOU
I BELIEVE WHAT YOU ARE SAYING
EVERYONE HAS THEIR OPINIONS ABOUT EVERY CASE
IT MAKES ME FEEL BAD
WHERE IS IT NOT GOOD
MY CHILDREN LIVE IN THE CITY
I WAS A TECH WRITER AND HE WAS AN ENGINEER
AS SOON AS I HAD THEM
COVER HIS EARS
THAT MAKES SENSE TOO
JUST THINGS AROUND THE HOUSE
I NEED TO GET MY VISION TESTED
HERE COMES MY FRIEND
DAY
I WILL COOK AT LEAST SOMETHING TO EAT
I HATE TO DUST AND CLEAN THE HOUSE
DO I HAVE ANY TIME FOR FOOD OR DO I HAVE TO GO WITHOUT
THEY HAD A LOT OF THEM
IT MUST BE SO NICE FOR YOU
IT'S OPENING NEXT YEAR
I AGREE THAT THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO APPEAL TO PEOPLE IN THE FUTURE
IT'S A BUSINESS DECISION
NO PROBLEM THIS IS NOT A TROUBLE
HOW DO YOU DECIDE
WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS
GUESS WHO IS COMING HOME NEXT WEEK
YOU'RE LEARNING THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE NATION
I ALSO GOT A PIECE OF CHROME
THERE WAS A COMPANY IN HOUSTON THAT SOLD THEM
I GUESS THE SANITATION DEPARTMENT
DO YOU HAVE HORSES
IT'S THIRTY DEGREES THIS MORNING
WELL AT THE PRESENT TIME I HAVE TWO DOGS
HAVE NOT
THE GIRLS JOINED
THEY ARE TEMPTING AT TIMES
SO WHAT'S THE PROGRAM FOR TODAY
HE HAD OCCASIONALLY SENT HER MOTHER MONEY
IT SEEMS SILLY IN RETROSPECT
MY CALL DID NOT GO THROUGH
IT USES MORE MUSCLES THAN ANY OTHER EXERCISE
I GUESS HE'S LEAVING
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE THERE
WE WENT WITH THEM TO GERMANY
BUT I WAS THINKING ABOUT IT
I WILL BE HERE ALL DAY
I WORK OUT OF MY HOME
MINE LOOKS REAL GOOD
HERE IS THAT
HE HAS CHANGED HIS WAYS
I FORGET WHERE SHE GOT IT
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO NOW
THIS IS REALLY A LOT FOR ME
THE THING BEHIND MY HEAD FELL OUT
ALL THOSE FACTORS PLAYED A PART
I HAVE PROBABLY HEARD HIM
THE NINETEEN FORTIES AND I
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I HAVE
IN SOME OF THE MORE CROWDED STATES
A CENTIMETER IS ABOUT THE WIDTH OF YOUR THUMBNAIL
THEY ARE LIKE THAT
IT WAS REALLY PRETTY
I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO DIE
WE DO AN AWFUL LOT OF CAMPING
NOT ALL THE TIME
IF I HAD TO DO IT ALL AGAIN I WOULD
IT WAS NICE TALKING TO YOU DUDLEY
YES I AM COMING HERE
NOW THAT I'VE STAYED HOME
WE JUST GOT A NEW FRISBEE THE OTHER DAY
BEING A MINI VAN
IT IS COMING HERE
SOME GUY THAT WAS ATTACKING WOMEN JOGGING
BEEN HERE ALL MY LIFE
POOR OR IN BETWEEN
WE HAVE TO GET HIM BACK TO THAT POINT AGAIN
I THINK IT IS GETTING WORSE
FINAL VERSION
I'VE TAKEN SOME CLASSES AND I'VE MADE A FEW FRIENDS
SCOUTS AND SPORTS WERE HIS TWO BIG THINGS
HOPE YOU FEEL
I'VE HEARD THAT SHE'S DONE REAL COOL THINGS
I SAW AN INTERESTING STATISTIC ABOUT THIS A FEW DAYS AGO
ON ONE OF THE LOCAL TALK SHOWS HERE
YOU LIKE MUSIC
SHE HAD A DISPUTE
THIS IS ME AFTER GETTING A CREDIT CARD
I CAN'T REMEMBER WHO THE ARTIST WAS ON THAT
DRUG TESTING IN THE WORK PLACE
I USED TO USE IT QUITE A BIT
DID THAT SCARE YOU A LITTLE BIT
THERE IS ONLY ONE FAN IN THIS BIG ROOM
WHY DON'T YOU GO UP THERE AND HAVE A LOOK
I WASN'T LOOKING FOR A NEW JOB YET
I AM FROM ATLANTA GEORGIA
HE DIDN'T CARRY ANY TIES OR ANYTHING
END IT WHEN NEEDED
PLEASE DO NOT MAKE ME GO THERE NOW
STUFF LED TO AN EXPLOSION
THEY ARE A LITTLE OLD FOR THIS BASEBALL GAME
WHAT IS THE POINT OF THIS
EVEN THAT'S GOOD
I'VE GOT A PLACE IN THE COUNTRY
YOU DON'T LOOK AT IT
THE STORE WILL CLOSE AT TWELVE
HE WAS SUPER NICE TO ME
THEY DO NOT PROMISE ANYTHING SPECIFIC THESE DAYS
MY FATHER IS A WONDERFUL COOK
THEY MIGHT HAVE FIVE HUNDRED TROUBLED YOUTHS
SOMETHING THAT THE ORDINARY PERSON CAN
ALL THE WORK WE CAN GET DONE
IT'S NOT THAT MUCH OF A BOTHER REALLY
TELL ME WHERE THAT IS
THEY ARE COMING CLOSER
I JUST AM SCARED OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT
I DON'T KNOW THIS FOR A FACT
SINCE I'VE BECOME A PARENT
A REAL GOOD DOG
I USED TO WATCH A LOT
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS
YOU DIDN'T HEAR THIS FROM ME
I'VE HAD A CLASS ON PHYSICS
THERE'S NO SMOKING IN ANY PUBLIC AREAS
HE NEEDS TO BE REMEMBERED
YOU SHOULD STUDY ENGINEERING OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
LOW STRESS EXERCISE
DO NOT DO THAT
WHAT DID I MAKE THAT NIGHT
I KNOW TEACHERS ARE JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE
SHE REALLY ENJOYED HER LIFE
IT SEEMS TO BE REALLY GOOD FOR THEM
SAYING THIS DOES NOT MAKE IT RIGHT
THEN WE GET OUT OF THAT PHASE
WHICH MOVIE DID YOU ENJOY LAST WEEK
THE LATEST CEREAL
IT'S TOO MUCH TROUBLE
SHE IS THE BEST PERSON FOR THE JOB
THE VOID
I AM MAKING THIS TO EAT NEXT WEEK
I'VE ALWAYS HAD A BIG INTEREST
DO YOU ENVISION HIM AS A STARTER OR AS A BACKUP
I WORK AT CHANNEL SIX NEWS
SOME RIDICULOUS STUFF LIKE THAT
THE SOCIAL CHANGES
TRY NOT TO USE ANY INSECTICIDES AT ALL
THEY TRY TO STAY IN OFFICE
I DON'T EVEN OWN A BIKE
I HOPE YOU DO NOT NEED MY FAMILY
IT WAS WRITTEN AT A THIRD GRADE LEVEL
MY CHOICES WERE STILL BETTER
WE'RE NOT BUYING ANYTHING AT THIS POINT IN TIME
A DIFFERENT TURN
WE SHOULD TURN AROUND AND GO BACK
I DON'T LIKE TO WATCH ANYTHING
THAT IS COMFORTABLE
I SAW THAT MOVIE TOO
HOW DO YOU DO
MEN CAN DO HOUSE WORK JUST AS EASILY AS WOMEN
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS NEW POLICY
I HAVE MADE MY DECISION
BASICALLY THIS IS YOUR DECISION
LATELY MY DAUGHTER HAS STARTED A NEW COMPANY
GO TO LUNCH FROM TWELVE TO TWO
DID THEY GIVE YOU DRUG TESTING
I'M ORIGINALLY FROM OHIO
I HOPE YOU ARE RIGHT
IT IS MADE RIGHT HERE
I MEAN WE'RE TALKING
YOU JUST COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT THEY WOULD
HOW DO THEY HELP
REALLY KIND OF GONE THE ROUNDS
OTHER THREE WHO WENT
WE HAD TWO BASEBALL BLEACHERS FULL OF PEOPLE
YOU ARE VERY TIRED
AND THEN THE NEXT ONE DOWN IS IN THE MARINES
LET'S DO THIS ANOTHER DAY
ALL THESE OTHER GUYS DO IT TOO
THEY'RE IN THERE
MY BROTHER CAN DO IT
THEY CAN PROVIDE FOR SOCIETY
WHEN I DON'T HAVE MONEY
SHE WENT ACROSS SNOW FIELD
THEY'RE GETTING VOTES
I GUESS IT IS NOT A VERY BIG PLACE
THEY HOPE YOU HAVE FAITH
I DID IT FOR THREE YEARS
AND SUCCESSIVE ANSWERS
I MEAN WHAT WAS IT FOR
BUT AT ONE POINT THEY'RE GOING TO OUTGROW YOU
EASIER THAN CHICKEN DINNER
EDUCATION IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THESE FAMILIES
FLUORESCENT COLORS
WE FOUND THAT IN JAMAICA
IT WAS NO DIFFERENT FROM IRAQ
I THINK SOMEBODY WILL MEASURE HOW FAR THAT IS
THOSE JURORS DON'T KNOW WHAT THE LAW IS
YOU CAN PICK WHICHEVER ONE YOU WANT
I HAD A CARPET CLEANING SERVICE CALL ME THREE TIMES THIS WEEK
DON'T YOU HAVE TO DO IT AS PART OF ITS DECISION
NOT HERE PLEASE
ARE THEY THIRSTY
BUT PUTTING HIM IN A HOME DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT
LIKE A TASTE OF SOMETHING DIFFERENT
HE HAS A GOOD MORAL BACKGROUND
BECAUSE OF THE PLEASURE YOU GET FROM IT
HOW IS THE DISEASE TRANSMITTED
I NEVER MADE ONE FOR MYSELF THOUGH
YOU CAN RELATE TO THAT
YOU JUST END UP THROWING IT AWAY MOST OF THE TIME
I WANTED TO WAIT FOR YOU BUT IT WAS GETTING LATE
WHAT CHANGES WOULD YOU MAKE
PLEASE BRING MY GLASSES HERE
I PLAY VIDEO GAMES EVERY DAY
I HOPE THIS WILL WORK OUT
ITS GOT A LOT OF BEDROOMS AND BATHROOMS
THEY CLEAN MY GLASSES
THERE ARE PLENTY OF GOOD PEOPLE IN THE WORLD
THE COUPLE LIVES IN PITTSBURGH
CAN YOU FIND A PROGRAM THAT YOU LIKE
THAT'S ANOTHER LITTLE THING
IS PEACE CORPS STILL ACTIVE DOWN IN THERE
NOW I DANCE FOR JOY
OH I THINK SO TOO
YES YOU HAVE IT RIGHT
IT'S SORT OF UNUSUAL REALLY
THAT WAS IN THE WATER
PUT THE RICE INTO THE RICE COOKER
THE MEASURES ALREADY PASSED A SENATE COMMITTEE
I LIKE MY COLLEGE MORE NOW
EXCEPT I STENCILED MY WALL
THEY LIKE MY NURSE
PEOPLE WILL COME NOW
I TOLD YOU THE VIEW FROM HERE IS GREAT
OUR CLASS WAS ONLY HALF FULL TODAY
YOU'VE READ THAT ONE BEFORE
THOSE WERE BIG POLITICAL EVENTS
YOU NEED IT RIGHT HERE
WE CHAT AT EACH OTHER
THEY TELL YOU WHERE I AM
I'VE BEEN HERE THREE YEARS
I HAVEN'T TAUGHT AT ANY SCHOOLS IN IOWA
MY HUSBAND ALWAYS SAYS HE EARNS IT
PEOPLE ARE JUST TOTALLY UNFEELING
THEY HAVE ALREADY EXPLORED THE ENTIRE HOUSE
WHAT SPORTS THAT YOU ARE ACTIVE IN
THERE ARE MANY OTHER THINGS THAT I KNOW
WAIT FOR YOUR TURN IN THIS ROOM WITH BOOKS
I CAN'T COME BECAUSE MY FAMILY IS HERE
WHEN ARE YOU JOINING
SHOULD I TAKE THIS AWAY
I AM NOT QUITE SURE ABOUT IT
THEY ARE NOT COMING HERE
HELLO PLEASE CLEAN THAT UP
CLOSER PLEASE
I AM FREE IN THE EVENING TO READ THE BOOK
WHEN I WAS STILL SMOKING
WASN'T THAT FUN
OUR DIVISION DOES NOT HAVE A DRESS CODE POLICY
THAT'S THE SIGNAL
IS IT THAT
MY FEET BOTHER ME
MORE STAKEHOLDERS ARE JOINING THE CONVERSATION
I'M KIND OF OUT OF IT RIGHT NOW
CHOICE MEANS RESPECT AND IT MEANS CONSENT
SHE TRIED TO FEEL CONFIDENT ABOUT HER DECISION
THEY NEED EXPOSURE TO EVERY SUBJECT
I MIGHT REMEMBER TO DO IT OR I MIGHT NOT
WHAT SHALL WE DO
DO YOU STILL NEED MY COMPANY
I WAS WORRIED FOR A LITTLE WHILE
WE HAVE A BIG OLD FARMHOUSE
I BOUGHT THIS GAME FOR THE BOYS
WHAT YOU SAID SOUNDS IMPORTANT
THEY WOULD TEND NOT TO
YES I FEEL VERY THIRSTY
WHAT TIME WILL THEY COME HERE
MY PARENTS WOULD HAVE A FIT ABOUT THIS
IT WAS NOT WORTH IT
WE HAVE A LOT THAT NEEDS BE DONE
INCREASE IN VOID VOLUME
I'VE NEVER REALLY SERVED MY COUNTRY
I HAVE A JIG SAW AND A SCROLL SAW
I CAN SEE THIS IS QUITE HARD
THE DECISION WAS NOT WELCOMED BY ALL
THEY'RE USUALLY WRONG TOO
A LOCAL PERSON GETS THIS
THEY DO NOT LIKE MY FAMILY
PRETTY MUCH A LOT OF TELEVISION
UNIQUE SHOW AND VERY WELL DONE
OKAY HOW IS IT
YOU CLEAN MY COMPUTER
IT WAS A RELATIVELY NICE ENVIRONMENT
THAT HAPPENS ON OCCASION
I JUST DON'T FEEL RIGHT
I WANT TO SELL THIS OLD PIECE FOR A LOT OF MONEY
THERE IS NO POSSIBLE WAY THAT YOU COULD DO IT
OKAY I AM READY AND CAN YOU MOVE THE THINGS ON MY DESK SO I CAN SEE THE MONITOR PLEASE
BEEF AND BROCCOLI STRIPS
HE CALLED FOUR TIMES ALREADY
WE ARE GOOD TOGETHER AS A TEAM
MY FATHER WAS BEING VERY FUNNY IN THE MORNING
WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND TODAY
WHAT IS COMFORTABLE
ARE YOU COMING
IT'S A REALLY GOOD MOVIE
NORTH OF HERE IS A SMALL COMPANY
WHAT DO YOU USUALLY DO IN THE MORNING
HOW MANY CATS DO YOU HAVE
WHEN THEY RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S THEIR TAX MONEY AT STAKE
PROFESSORS FROM OTHER UNIVERSITIES WILL PRESENT THEIR RESEARCH
ON THE VERGE OF COUNTRY WESTERN
I'VE ENJOYED IT
IT'S LIKE FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS
IT WAS TAKING THE WHOLE THING
I AM LOOKING FOR A DIFFERENT JOB
NOW I JUST HAVE TO FINISH IT THOUGH
HE IS A PROSECUTING ATTORNEY
DO YOU HAVE IT
I WAS JUST ONE OF THOSE
THIS IS REALLY VERY GOOD
SHE ENJOYS THAT KIND OF STUFF
DO THAT RIGHT
IT'S REALLY NEAT
HE NEVER REALLY GOT IN A GAME
AND PRETEND LIKE HE'S PLAYING GAMES YOU KNOW
WE OCCASIONALLY GO OUT ON THE WATER ON OUR SAILBOAT
I'VE TAKEN MAYBE FOUR OR FIVE TRIPS THERE
HOW CAN I AVOID BEING INFECTED BY A VIRUS
THERE IS NOT A LOT OF FARM LAND THERE
I'LL GET AROUND TO IT
MAKE HIM SERVE FIVE YEARS
TWO COLUMNS ON THE FRONT
THEY CAN DO WHATEVER THEY WANT
IT'S NOT THAT I'M NOT ENJOYING MYSELF
YOU HAVE MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE
LIVES ARE GETTING BETTER AROUND THE WORLD
I REALLY HAVEN'T SEEN ANY MOVIES LATELY
STAY SAFE AND ENJOY YOUR TIME OUT THERE
EVERYTHING SEEMS FINE HERE
IT'S A COMMUNITY CENTER
GO OVER THERE
BUT IT HAS A PRETTY LOW CRIME RATE
WITHIN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS
THAT'S NOT VERY LIKELY
THIS IS QUITE UNUSUAL
IT'S BEEN CLOUDY AND DREARY EVERY DAY THIS WEEK
VOTING WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE
TREAT THE SAME WITH DUE REMEDIAL MEASURE PROMPTLY
THIS CITY HAS A VERY HIGH COST OF LIVING
I CAN TALK TO YOU WHILE I WORK
I AM YOU
YOU NEED TO TAKE CARE OF A PROBLEM BEFORE IT GROWS BIG
I NEED THAT
I WILL CONTINUE NO MATTER HOW ANNOYING IT GETS
IT MADE US BE MORE TOGETHER
I'M NOT SURE
MY BROTHER LIVES
THIS IS MY ITINERARY
I GUESS THEY DO THAT SO THEY DON'T GET SCOOPED
THAT WAS TWO DAYS A WEEK
SO FAR NO CASUALTIES HAVE BEEN REPORTED
MOST TIME THEY RUN AWAY FROM YOU
AN ALLUSION
THEY HAD FIVE OR SIX SERVANTS
JUST HAVE TO START ALL OVER
ARE YOU IT
THANKS A BUNCH
WHERE ARE THEY
I LIKE HELP
I WILL SEE THIS GAME VERY SOON
THOSE SMALL LITTLE TRUCKS AND CARS LIKE THAT
WE HAD A CASE LIKE THAT LAST YEAR
IT GETS A LITTLE BIT OF EVERYTHING
I'M NOT FROM MINNEAPOLIS
YOU JUST HAVE TO DECIDE
YOU HOPE IT IS GOOD
FOUR HUNDRED HOURS
IT STARTS AT THE COURTS
SAILING ON A BOAT CAN BE VERY RELAXING
WINTER WEATHER IS KIND OF A PROBLEM AROUND HERE
NOW THAT I'VE GOTTEN PAST THAT
JOHNSON IS VOWING TO APPEAL THE DECISION
I DON'T SEE MUCH POLLUTION NEAR THE FACTORY
THEY ARE RIGHT HERE
NOT THIS PAST FALL BUT THE PREVIOUS FALL
WHO SAYS THIS IS THE FUTURE
SOME PEOPLE ARE REALLY GOOD AT IT
ARE YOU COMING UP HERE
THIS PROGRAM WILL GIVE MANY CHOICES
CHECK THE SOFTWARE VERSION BY TYPING THIS COMMAND
GET INTO THE PROBLEM
YOU ARE MANIPULATING THE EQUATION
THEY JUST RAISED THEM TO TWELVE THIS YEAR
AFTER THAT THEY WILL BE DESTROYED
IN ANY EVENT MY DECISION WAS MADE DAYS AGO
NORTH SIDE IS GETTING VERY COLD LATELY
I DON'T KNOW THAT WE REALLY HAVE A BUDGET
THE CITY HAS FEDERAL FUNDING TO BUILD A NEW BRIDGE
THEY DO NOT
WE DO WHAT WE CAN
MY SISTER KIND OF GOT HERSELF ON THE OPPOSITE END OF THAT
I HOPE THEY NEED MUSIC
I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WOULD BE GREAT TO HAVE TWIN BOYS
I WAS THINKING OF THE RECIPE THAT USES ONION AND GARLIC
WE WORK VERY HARD ON THIS
THEY WANT EVERYBODY EDUCATED
I WANT TO REALLY CHALLENGE THEM
MY FAITH IS RIGHT HERE
HOW DO YOU DO IT RIGHT HERE
YES THEY ARE COMING
MY LITTLE GIRL LIKES BLUE MORE THAN PINK
MY FAMILY IS OKAY
MY NURSE IS VERY GOOD
YOU CAN PAY US WITH A CHECK IF THAT HELPS
I ALMOST ACCIDENTALLY GOT THE NEXT CAR
I'M IN THE THIRD YEAR OF MY NURSING COURSE
LET'S GET STARTED EARLY IN THE MORNING
I DON'T KNOW IF I'M MAKING ANY SENSE OR NOT
OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT WE ENCOUNTERED SOME
HELP MY FAMILY CLEAN PLEASE
HE CAN LOOK AFTER THE CHILD FOR A FEW HOURS
I GUESS I'M PARTIAL TO THE NATIONAL PARKS THAT HAVE BIG TREES
BECAUSE LIKE I SAID
WHAT DO I TELL MY FAMILY
WE SPEND SO MUCH TIME WITH OUR FAMILIES
DISHES THAT ARE FIXED IN A CHINESE RESTAURANT
MY FAMILY IS NOT VERY TIRED
I HAD A FRIEND THAT BROKE UP WITH ME TWO YEARS AGO
CATCH ME IF YOU CAN
I'M OF ITALIAN DESCENT
YOU CAN EAT A WHOLE BIG PLATE OF FOOD THERE
THEY HAVE BUILT UP ONE MOUNTAIN
TREE BARK ALL OVER HER LAWN
MY DOORS WERE OKAY FRONT AND BACK
HOPE YOU DO GOOD
OTHER PEOPLE ARE POOR
HOW OLD ARE YOUR GIRLS
AND THAT BRINGS ME TO MY POINT
IT'S STILL GREEN
MY MOTHER IS HERE SOMEWHERE
COLLECT YOUR CANS
I WANT TO MAKE THIS VERY EASY
THOSE ARE NO GOOD ANYMORE
THEY QUIT MAKING THOSE
NINE YEAR OLD DAUGHTER PLAYS CELLO
HAVE YOU DONE THIS BEFORE
MY PARENTS NEVER LET ME WATCH ANYTHING LIKE THAT
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE LATEST SEIZURE
IT WAS A SPAGHETTI WESTERN MOVIE
INTERESTING THING YOU WANT TO DO
I FEEL BETTER ALREADY
SOME OF IT IS KIND OF WORN OUT
GO OVER THERE AND REBUILD ALL THOSE
BASICALLY WHAT WILL YOU DO FOR THE EMPLOYEES
I GUESS SIXTEEN OR SEVENTEEN WITH MY FAMILY
I LIKE TELLING JOKES
SOME PEOPLE PREY ON THAT
YOU DON'T REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND
A LOT OF DAYS I'LL GET TWO AND THREE CALLS
SO YOU'RE DOING IT YOURSELF
IT COST FIVE DOLLARS BETWEEN HERE AND THERE
ISN'T THAT INTERESTING
I TOOK A LEAVE
IT WAS JUST BASED ON THE FACTS
HIS VOICE WAS NEARLY DROWNED OUT BY THE CROWD
TO MOVE FORWARD WE HAVE TO MAKE BOTH VERSIONS VISIBLE
YOU'RE DEVELOPING YOUR IMAGINATION
I CAN NEVER QUITE STAY CURRENT WITH THAT
PARENTS ARE INTERESTED IN QUALITY EDUCATION
MY DAUGHTER IS TWENTY ONE NOW
AND NO MATTER WHERE YOU BUILD IT THEY WILL COME
THAT TIME IS MINUSCULE
I'LL BE THERE IN THE AFTERNOON
PLAY THERE UNDER SUPERVISION
I DON'T READ A LOT OF BOOKS
AT THIS POINT I DECIDED TO FILE THE LAWSUIT
DON'T ALLOW THEM TO SELL IT THERE
MOST OF US THINK THIS IS PRETTY GOOD
I WILL BE HOME WITH MY FAMILY
LET US GO AROUND THE HOUSE AND TAKE A LOOK
THEY'RE IN GOOD SPIRITS
I THINK THAT THAT'S BEEN PROVEN IN FACT
I HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE WITH CARS
I HAVEN'T SEEN THIS MOVIE YET
THEY WERE MAKING TELEVISION SHOWS AT THE TIME
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO GO FISHING BEFORE SUNRISE
SUSAN IS ANNOYING
I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT IT
YOU CAN PAY ME TWO HUNDRED NOW
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT AGE YOU HAVE
I KNOW THAT THE ELDERLY CAN EASILY BE ABUSED
IT'S QUICK READING YOU KNOW
I DO NOT HAVE MY COMPUTER
GIVEN OUT BY THOSE COMPANIES
WAIT FOR ANYONE TO JOIN
I HAVE NO MUSIC
I LIKE HOW COMFORTABLE MY FAMILY IS
HOW DO YOU MEASURE IT
WHY DON'T YOU COME HERE
I'M REALLY ENJOYING IT SO FAR
I'M NOT COUNTING ON IT
BE CAREFUL ABOUT THAT BACK THEN
IT LOOKS PRETTY SUSPENSEFUL
I AM NOT HUNGRY
DO YOU TAKE CREDIT CARD
WHAT FUN IT IS TO PLAY AT HOME
FROM MY POINT OF VIEW HE IS
I'VE JUST READ A LOT ABOUT IT
PLACES USUALLY THAT I WOULDN'T BE GOING
THEN IT HAS LITTLE ROOMS OFF OF IT
THERE WILL COME A DAY WHEN YOU WILL FEEL BETTER
WE'D GET ONE MORE CHECK AND THAT WOULD BE IT
ZIPPER CLOSURE
WE MUST FIND SOMEWHERE TO STAY TONIGHT
I FELT THAT WAS A LITTLE INSENSITIVE
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
THEY'RE REAL DIFFICULT TO CATCH
INSTEAD OF TAKING THEM UP THERE
REWARD OR WHATEVER
THAT WOULD BE REAL GOOD FOR US
I WAS ORIGINALLY TESTING THIS GROUP CLASS
WHERE IS MY FAMILY GOING
WE'VE GOT TWO TEAMS OF EQUAL STRENGTH
THINK IT WOULD BE HARD
THEY DON'T NEED THAT SEVEN DAY WAITING PERIOD
AND NOW IT'S TIME TO GET RID OF THEM
YOU NEED TO RENT THE FIRST ONE FIRST
BUT IF YOU REALLY WANT TO RELAX HAVE A MASSAGE
IN THE FEDERAL BUDGET
THEY ARE CAUSING PROBLEMS
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL THIS TIME
ARE YOU SAYING THERE IS NO CRIME IN YOUR CITY
SO WHAT'S THE POINT OF ALL OF THIS
YOU COULD JOIN A WALKING CLUB
IS MY NURSE CLOSER
THEY SUPPORTED IT
I FINALLY GOT OUT
YOU FEEL TIRED
MAYBE I WILL USE IT NEXT WEEK
WELCOME TO OUR HOME
I'M A SINGLE MOM
A HUNDRED AND TWO SOMETIMES
IT'S NOT VERY INSPIRING
IT'S JUST SOMEWHERE TO DRIVE ANOTHER CAR TO
WE GO ON VACATION AT DIFFERENT PLACES EVERY YEAR
A BIG COLLEGE THING
I WILL NOT BUY MORE OF THESE
THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM DOING IT THE FIRST TIME
YOU ALWAYS GET INTO READING THE PAPER
SHE MOVED AWAY LAST YEAR
DID YOU ENJOY THIS EPISODE
I THINK THAT ABOUT A MAJORITY OF THE PLACES IN THE UNITED STATES
AND I NEED TO KEEP THAT GOING
SHE ACTED LIKE IT DIDN'T BOTHER HER AT ALL
I ENJOYED OUR DISCUSSION
THE RESTAURANTS IN PORTLAND OREGON ARE PRETTY GOOD
CHIPS AND SALSA AND PEANUTS
IT'S STILL GOING ON
I WILL MEET YOU AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS
SHE WAS WONDERFUL
I WOULDN'T TAKE IT APART
AT THE SAME TIME OIL PRODUCTION KEEPS RISING
THIS GAVE ME A LOT OF TROUBLE
DO YOU NEED HELP HERE
IT'S FAR BEYOND ME
OUR CHILDREN SOON GREW OUT OF THEIR NEW CLOTHES
I AGREE WITH THE UPPER AND LOWER LEVEL MANAGERS
I THINK I KNOW WHERE IT'S GOING TO GO
I DON'T GET WHAT YOU ARE SAYING
THIS IS SUCH A GOOD MOVIE TO WATCH
THIS IS A VERY BIG HOUSE
IT'S A PLEASURE TO WORK WITH YOU
CUSTOMER DEPLOYS TEMPLATE ON COMPUTING ENGINE
ABOUT A THOUSAND BAD CHECKS
I DON'T GET TO WATCH
WHAT DO THEY HAVE
THAT IS A BIG PROBLEM
I HOPE YOU COME TO MY HOUSE
THAT'S ONE WAY TO END A CONVERSATION
THEN ADD SOIL TO THE BOTTOM OF YOUR BONSAI POT
THEY TELL YOU I AM HUNGRY
I HAVE TWO OR THREE
IT'S GOT AN OFFICE DOWN HERE
AND THEY ARE RIGHT UP TO A POINT
IF YOU DON'T PAY IT OFF WITHIN THAT MONTH
I WORK VERY HARD
IN SOME OF THE CRITICAL THINGS
IT JUST REALLY COMES DOWN TO THE FACT THAT PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE
YOU HAVE MADE A GREAT CHOICE
I LIKE MY GARDEN TOO
IS IN GOOD STANDING IN AMERICA AND CHINA
WORK FOR ANOTHER SCHOOL TO BE BUILT
DO YOU WORK WITH A PRIVATE CORPORATION OR WITH THE GOVERNMENT
AND SO THEY JUST FIT IN THERE
THIS IS SUCH A BIG CITY
JOIN US AT MAINE BEER COMPANY
MY NEXT TRIP IS GOING TO BE TO TEXAS
I THINK GOING SIX WEEKS MAKES SENSE
THIS SOUNDS REALLY WONDERFUL
I LIKE TO WATCH COMEDY
I HOPE MY FAMILY IS CLOSER
TRIED TO BREAK THAT OFF
WHAT POINT WERE YOU TRYING TO MAKE IN ANY CASE
IN A WAY IT'S NOT
THE WEEKEND BEFORE LAST
THEY'RE NOT TRYING TOO HARD THESE DAYS
I WAS GOING TO DO IT
WE FOUND A REAL GOOD INTEREST RATE
I'M TALKING ABOUT AIR POLLUTION
TELL MY FAMILY I DO NOT FEEL HUNGRY
I NEED MY GLASSES
THAT IS NOT VERY GOOD
THERE IS JUST SO MUCH GOING ON
MY NURSE IS NOT COMING HERE
IS MY COMPUTER VERY BAD
SINCE HE GOES TO NURSERY SCHOOL
IT TAKES TWO AND A HALF HOURS TO GET THERE
I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA
THEY WERE VERY GOOD
TELL HER THAT YOU WILL JOIN THE COLLEGE
THE GOVERNMENT MADE THIS NEW FOOD POLICY
IN MANY WAYS EACH GENRE IS A SPORT UNTO ITSELF
IT'S NOT THE TIMES
WHAT ARE GLASSES
YOUR FEEDBACK IS WELCOME AS USUAL
WHAT IS OUR BUDGET AFTER TAX
I ALSO THINK THAT WOULD BE REALLY GOOD
USUALLY THIS TIME IS A CONSIDERABLE INVESTMENT
THIS WILL GET EASIER SOON
AMERICA IS THE BIGGEST COUNTRY IN THE NORTH
I HAVE DONE THIS ONLY ONCE BEFORE
IT'S THE THIRTY FIVE OR FORTY THOUSAND DOLLAR ONE
THE COAL MINING REGIONS OF SIBERIA
WHAT'S THE WORD I WANT
TAKES AN AWFUL LOT OF TIME
MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS NEED MY HELP
DO YOU NEED MY HELP TO LOOK AFTER THE BABY
THESE TURNED OUT EXACTLY AS I HAD ENVISIONED
WHAT IS THE CURRENT STATE OF THE EARLY ACCESS VERSION
IT SHOULD BE A MESS
A NATURAL GAS
I AM IN THE MIDDLE OF AN IMPORTANT CALL
WE ARE MISSIONARIES ACTUALLY
I WANT TO TAKE A FEW OF THESE
THINGS ARE GOING PRETTY WELL DOWN HERE
IT IS CLEAN
DO YOU KNOW WHO CALLED FOR HELP
I THINK I SEE SOME CHANGE IN ATTITUDES THERE
I TELL YOU I AM THIRSTY
ROYAL BANK OF CANADA
SHE ENJOYED HER SPORTS CAR
THEY WERE REFERRED TO AS SAVANTS
THEY'VE MADE SUCH ADVANCES IN COMPUTERS
THAT IS NOT RIGHT
YOU ARE GOOD
I HAVEN'T CALLED IN A COUPLE OF DAYS
THINGS HAVE CHANGED IN DETROIT
ROBBERIES OR THINGS LIKE THAT
I FEEL FAITH HERE
WHEN THEY RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S THEIR TAX MONEY
MORE APPEALS MEAN MORE POINTS
IT'S LIKE THIS OLD HOUSE
I AM GOING TO BET YOU THAT IS A LILY
I WILL LET YOU START
WE'VE SEEN BETTER JOBS
IT WAS JUST TOO PERFECT AT ALL TIMES
IS MY NURSE OKAY
THIS IS FUSION AS LIBERATION
I AM DOING FINE FOR NOW
THEY DON'T EVEN CHECK MY SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER
THERE IS KIND OF A PREDICTABLE PATTERN TO IT
THE BUSINESS WILL GROW WITH SOME LUCK
SO STRAP IN AND ENJOY THE RIDE
SOMEONE WILL GIVE YOU A CALL NEXT WEEK
MY SISTER IN LAW IS GOING TO HAVE A BABY
YOU PROBABLY GET THIS
JUST A LITTLE OVER A YEAR AGO
I HADN'T EVEN THOUGHT OF THAT
THAT'S REALLY WEIRD
L O L
SPEAKING OF NOISE
IT DRIVES ME CRAZY
I WAS VERY IMPRESSED BY THEM
THAT'S WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE
WHAT ARE SOME OF THE BENEFITS OF VISUALIZATION
TELL MY NURSE YOU ARE HUNGRY
CERTAINLY THE PURPOSE IS NOT VERY ETHICAL
YOU GO AHEAD FIRST
CAN YOU GET MY HEAD IN THE RIGHT POSITION HELP
NOTICED THAT WHEN I WAS A KID
THAT'S WHAT I HEAR
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
WE NEED A WINNER IN THIS TOWN
NOTHING HAPPENED DURING THE SEVENTIES
SCHOOL DAY CAN BE VERY LONG
THIS IS HER SECOND MUSIC RECORD
YOU DON'T USE ANY CREDIT CARDS
SHE HAS TWO LITTLE BOYS
WHERE THEY ARE GOING
MY FAMILY IS HERE
I'M GETTING A BAD GUT FEELING ABOUT THIS
DO THEY TEACH LONG DIVISION TO KIDS IN SCHOOL
ARE YOU CLOSER
JOIN THIS WEEK'S SHOW
I HAVE A NUMBER OF VISUAL CHOICES TO MAKE THIS FALL
PLEASE SIT HERE WITH ME FOR SOME TIME
I NEED SUCCESS
SO I'LL WEAR A PANT SUIT IN CASE I HAVE TO SHOOT
IT WOULDN'T HAVE MADE A DIFFERENCE
SHE'S GONE THREE MORNINGS
WE HAVE SOME IN LAWS
WE DON'T KNOW HOW LONG IT WILL BE
I SAW CITY SLICKERS
I LIKE THIS HOUSE VERY MUCH
YOU ARE GOING OUTSIDE
I HAD A CALL THE OTHER DAY FROM BIRMINGHAM
AT THIS POINT THE DAMAGE IS DONE
DIVISION OF WORK IS IMPORTANT IN A TEAM
IS THAT WHAT THAT WAS
IT'S HARD NOT TO LIKE IT
CLEAN WATER IS IMPORTANT FOR LIVING HERE
THEY LIKE MY GLASSES LIKE THAT
ON A PRETTY GOOD BASIS
IT IS YOUR CHOICE WHERE YOU WANT TO GO
I THINK THAT'S A POSSIBILITY
TEN DOLLARS FOR THE BRIDGES AND THE ROADS
IT'S THE FIRST AND ONLY TIME I'VE DONE SOMETHING SO DISGUSTING
YOU WOULD NOT KNOW THAT
IS MY NURSE GOING
WE ARE ALMOST THROUGH
THAT IS GOOD
FOR ALL THE OLDER PEOPLE
WHICH TOPIC DID YOU TALK ABOUT IN YOUR CLASS
GOSH I'M SO WORRIED ABOUT THIS ALIEN INVASION
WHICH IS YOUR FAVOURITE CAPITAL CITY
YOUR ROOM LOOKS VERY NEAT
SOMEONE WILL LET YOU IN OUR HOUSE IN THE NEW CITY
SHOW SOME RESPECT
HELLO WHERE IS MY GOODBYE
THAT'S THE SAME THING HERE
IN A WAY THAT HAPPENED THIS PAST SEASON
JUST LIGHT READING
FROM MY APARTMENT
TAKE YOUR SICK LEAVE
I WENT TO EXACTLY SEVEN PLACES
THEN WE WENT UP THE MOUNTAIN
PEOPLE ARE DROPPING OUT OF SCHOOL
I HAVE IT UP
EVERYTHING IS GEARED TOWARDS YOUNG PEOPLE
THEY'RE GOOD BOTH WAYS
OLD PEOPLE WILL NEED HELP WITH THIS
PICK A NICE PLACE OUTSIDE
THE CLEANLINESS AND THAT TYPE OF THING
THAT WOULD NOT WORK FOR HIM
IT'S LIKE A MILL
ARE YOU A FAN OF THE RED SOX TOO
IS HE THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL EMPLOYEE
MAYBE YOU LIVE TOO FAR AWAY FROM YOUR FAMILY
WE SHOULD TRY TO BUY MORE LOCAL FOOD
THE LITTLE BOY DIES
YOU HOPE THEY ARE NOT HERE
IS THERE A LOT OF SAND
I WAS DOING THEM A FAVOR
I DON'T CARE FOR ROCK
WE GO BACKPACKING FIFTEEN OR TWENTY MILES
WHAT WAS GOING ON THERE
I DO NOT WANT TO LISTEN TO THIS ANYMORE
EVERY SINGLE MONTH WITHOUT FAIL
HOW DO YOU GET YOUR MAIN SOURCE OF CURRENT EVENTS
I'M NOT MUCH IN FAVOR OF IT
WHAT CLASS DO WE HAVE TODAY
MAYBE GIVE THEM A REFRESHER DRIVING COURSE
THEY DO LOW IMPACT STUFF NOW
USE THAT WHENEVER THE OPPORTUNE MOMENT ARISES
IF YOU'RE AWARE OF THIS
I GUESS I BETTER GO
I PLAYED FOR THE FRISBEE CLUB IN HIGH SCHOOL
SHE IS SCARED TO DEATH OF THUNDERSTORMS
I DON'T MUCH CARE ABOUT THINGS LIKE THAT
WE HAVE A SEVEN YEAR OLD
HE LEFT THE CHIPS
I'M LOOKING FOR SOMETHING
AMERICAN CAR COMPANIES
IF THEY HAD A JURY OF PSYCHIATRISTS INSTEAD WOULD THE VERDICT CHANGE
THAT'S A WHOLE NEW FIELD OF STUDY
I ENJOY TAKING CARE OF THEM AND BRINGING THEM FLOWERS
BUSINESS WAS ESTABLISHED LAST WEEK
I NEED MY FAMILY
AFTER ABOUT TWELVE MINUTES OR SOMETHING
DON'T YOU THINK THIS IS VERY GOOD
I'VE NEVER HAD A CALL
THEY HAD SOME REAL FANCY NAMES FOR THEM
THAT'S WHAT WE HAD
I HOPE YOU LIKE MUSIC
I AM A FAN OF THE CLASSICAL ARTS
I AM CERTAIN THAT THIS IS TRUE
WE HAVE MADE A RIGHT CHOICE
LET'S TAKE YOUR CAR TO WORK
TELL MY FAMILY HELLO
THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE IT EVEN
SHE SPENDS LOTS OF MONEY ON THEM
I REALLY LIKE YOUR NEW CAR
NEVER GONNA RUN AROUND AND DESERT YOU
WHEN I WENT TO WORK FOR THEM
DO YOU HAVE A PLACE FOR MY CAR
IF YOU CAN'T WORK
I WANTED TO KNOW WHAT COMES AFTER THIS
IT DOES A FEW MORE THINGS
TELL MY FAMILY THEY ARE NOT HUNGRY
I MEAN YOU CAN EARN A LOT MORE MONEY
I SAW SOMEBODY WORKING VERY LATE
I LIKE TO GO TO THE CITY
SLEEPING BAGS ARE NOT COMFORTABLE
I'M JUST FINISHING ANOTHER ONE UP
YES I WOULD LIKE THAT VERY MUCH
TELL MY NURSE I DO NOT FEEL HUNGRY
EVERYTHING AROUND HERE IS SET UP THAT WAY
DECISIONS ARE EXPECTED BY THE END OF JUNE
WHERE ARE YOU GOING NEXT
IT'S OUR FIRST HOME
ACTUALLY I WENT THROUGH ALL THE BOOKS
THEY'VE GOT SOME
I DON'T MESS WITH IT
SHE DOESN'T THINK SHE COULD BE A MOTHER AT HOME
DOESN'T SEEM SO FAR
ARE THERE ANY OTHER GENRES OR SOUNDS YOU'RE INTERESTED IN EXPLORING
MY HUSBAND LEFT WITHOUT ME
IN INCHES OR CENTIMETERS
IT'S ONLY BEEN THAT WAY FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS
I GUESS IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE
THERE WAS ONE NOISE LIKE THAT
SO THIS LAST YEAR HE CHANGED IT
BUY ONE GET ONE FREE
BRING MY MUSIC HERE PLEASE
I QUIT WHEN I WAS PREGNANT WITH MY KIDS
I WAS ALWAYS A FAN
IT'S NICE TALKING WITH YOU
THIS WAS WHEN THE PEACE CORPS WERE FIRST STARTED
THEY ARE COMING RIGHT UP
CLEAN UP PLEASE
MY DAUGHTER HAS A WHITE CAT
IF I GOT A CHANCE TO SIT DOWN AT MY TYPEWRITER
DIDN'T HE KNOW THAT ALREADY
HER HUSBAND TOLD ME ABOUT HER NEW BUSINESS
I HOPE YOU DO NOT NEED MUSIC
WITH THE ABORTION ISSUES AND STUFF
HE DOESN'T BITE ANYBODY
THAT'S MY FAVORITE TEAM
I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THAT ONE
ON THE RADIATOR BEHIND THE DRESSER
YOU CAN SIT NEXT TO ME
WE ARE SEEING THAT HERE AS WELL
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN
SINCE THERE IS MUCH THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE HERE
I DO ALSO WATCH TELEVISION NEWS
I DON'T REALLY LIKE THE PIRATES
AS ANY CITY GROWS IT GETS MORE DANGEROUS
I HOPE YOU ARE NOT GOING THERE
NO MUSIC HERE
TO THE POINT
PLEASE BRING MY FAMILY HERE
WHAT A PLEASURE TO WORK WITH YOU
IT WILL PROBABLY BE VERY NICE
I THINK IT IS A WONDERFUL PLACE
WHERE THEY ARE NOT
HOW MANY DAYS OF SCHOOL ARE THERE IN A YEAR
BUT I GUESS YOU'RE ALWAYS ON CALL FOR IT
DON'T LET THEM SEE VIOLENCE AT HOME
TO WORK IN SOME PROGRAMS
WHAT ARE YOU TAKING WITH YOU TO THE COLLEGE CLASS
THAT'S A REAL WASTE TOO
WE'RE REAL CLOSE
I THINK WE HAVE A LOUSY SCHOOL SYSTEM
I AM THAT BAD
I'M FROM UP NORTH ALSO
ESSENTIALLY ANYTHING YOU CAN FIND IN A HOUSE
LET'S SEE ABOUT GETTING THE PARENTS MORE INVOLVED
IT WAS JUST SO REALISTIC
IS THIS YOUR DAY OFF
WE'VE GOT SOME BEETS
I HAVE REALLY BALLOONED UP SINCE THEN
THEY GAVE US NEW BUDGET TODAY
TELL MY NURSE GOODBYE
I THINK IT COULD AFFECT THE OUTCOME
I KNEW THIS WAS GOING TO BE A BAD CHOICE
GIVES HIM A LITTLE BIT OF THAT INDIVIDUAL TIME
THEY HAVE TO HAVE A DARN GOOD REASON
GIVE PEOPLE INSIGHT AND HELP THEM MAKE BETTER DECISIONS
YOU COULDN'T REALLY TALK
ENJOY YOUR EVENING AND THANK YOU FOR LISTENING
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS
WELL WHAT DO YOU THINK
ARE MY GLASSES VERY GOOD
SOME SHOWS ARE GOOD
WHAT IS THAT HERE
NOT A HUGE PART
DO YOU LIKE YOU
I HAVE THIS REALLY GOOD RECIPE FOR THIS
THEY HOPE THAT
I GUESS THIS IS REAL
I LIKE TO GET UP EARLY IN THE MORNING
THEY'RE JUST AWFUL
DOESN'T MEAN THAT ANY DECISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE
I DON'T KNOW IF IT WOULD BE HELPFUL OR NOT
JUST LUCKY TO HAVE A JOB
THERE ARE NO HILLS AROUND HERE
IT COULD ONLY HAPPEN IN A TOTALITARIAN REGIME
GIVE YOURSELF HALF DAY TO COOK THIS
I HAVE NOT SEEN HIM FOR MANY YEARS
I THINK SHE KEPT SAYING THAT
HE CAME OUT WITH THE SECOND ONE
THEY WERE FINED MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
IS IT WORTH BRINGING KIDS WITH US
SO I KIND OF GRABBED ON TO THAT TEAM
I DON'T THINK WE HAVE TOO MUCH TO GO ON HERE
DID YOU ENJOY THIS MOVIE
BUT THAT'S HOW WE GOT INTO A PROBLEM
MY TEACHER LOOKED AT IT EVERY WEEK
THEY'RE JUST GORGEOUS
THEY DON'T DRIVE THEM THAT MUCH
HOW ARE YOU EVEN HERE
HE'S TELLING ME TO START THE GRILL
I KNOW THIS IS A LOT FOR NOW
IT REALLY DOESN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE
SOCIAL ARBITRAGE
THEY'VE NOT HAD TO DO THAT ALL YEAR
LETS GO TO AN OPERA OR THE SYMPHONY OR SOMETHING
HAVE YOU MADE A DECISION YET
I'M IN MARKETING SALES
ARE THAT ALIVE ON MONDAY
I FELT I KNEW THEM FOR A LONG TIME
IT IS KIND OF HARD
IN THE WINTER TIME THERE WAS NO SMELL AT ALL
WHAT WAS IT CALLED
ETHICAL AND RELIGIOUS VIEWS ON NEED AND PLEASURE
SATAN REJOICED WITH HIS BIRTH
WHEN I CAME YOU WERE GONE
TELL MY NURSE I AM NOT THIRSTY
THAT CAR CUT US OFF ON THE HIGHWAY
CAN YOU TALK ME THROUGH THIS
I DON'T THINK I'M A REAL TRUE BELIEVER
THEY DIDN'T SEND HIM TO A PUBLIC SCHOOL
I AM NOT EVEN AWARE THAT I COULD HAVE SEEN IT
THEY DO NOT HAVE FAMILY
YOU PROBABLY HAVE A DIFFERENT SENSE THAN I HAVE
MY ANSWER IS NO THANK YOU
THIS IS THE MOST FUN PART
I'M ALSO IN DALLAS
THAT'S A WHOLE OTHER TOPIC TO BEGIN WITH
YOU GREW UP IN ORLANDO
IT JUST SEEMS LIKE I WAS SO BUSY ALL THE TIME BACK THEN
WHICH I THOUGHT WAS A LOT
HIS TREASURES COME WITH ANSWERS
MAYBE ONCE EVERY QUARTER OR SO
ACTUALLY PURCHASE THE GUN
I GREW UP FISHING
THIS WAY SNOW WILL NOT STICK TO THE CARS
THAT'S A SCIENCE IN ITSELF
I HAVE BEEN THERE
IF I CONTINUE TAKING GOOD CARE OF IT
SEEMS LIKE I JUST BOUGHT IT
SHOW ME WHAT YOU HAVE GOT THERE
A RECORD OF THE RAP SONGS OF THE EIGHTIES
CATS ARE PRETTY INDEPENDENT ANIMALS
IT'S A LOT LIKE CAMPING
I DO NOT HAVE MUSIC
YOU HAVE FAMILY
I KNOW WHAT IT MUST HAVE FELT LIKE
ARE YOU GOING THIS WEEK
I THINK THAT'S WHAT IT IS ABOUT
YOU'RE CLOSE TO THE SUBJECT
SHE'S THE LITTLE GIRL
GIVE HIM IT FOR A TRADE IN
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT GOING THERE
IF YOU LOOK ALL OVER THE PLACE IN THE OTHER COUNTRIES
THAT HAPPENS TO US SOMETIMES TOO
WE JUST MOVED HERE IN SEPTEMBER
THIS IS OUR WORK
THAT'S KIND OF THE SAME THING FOR ME
I NOTICED SOMETHING INTERESTING LAST TIME
IT HAPPENED OVER A VERY LONG PERIOD OF TIME
I THINK OUR FIVE MINUTES IS ABOUT DONE
I THINK IT'S INTERESTING
THE SUN WILL SET IN THE EVENING
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE TALK ABOUT
PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION AROUND HERE IS PRETTY GOOD
I DON'T VERY OFTEN
THE INDIVIDUAL INCIDENCE OR SOMETHING
WHO NEEDS SO MUCH STUFF TO LIVE
WE SHOULD CHANGE THE WAY WE THINK
THERE NEVER WILL BE
DEPENDING ON THE FIELD
I AM NOT OKAY
THE WHOLE PREMISE IS THAT THEY GO OUT
THIS SAYS A LOT ABOUT YOU THAN ME
AND THE ROYALS CAN THANK THEM FOR THAT
AS A BOY HIS FAMILY TRAVELED BY HORSE AND BUGGY
TWO WEEKS AGO
WALL HANGINGS
IT MAKES IT VERY CONVENIENT FOR US
YOU HAVE IT LIKE THAT
HE DUG A HOLE UNDER THE FENCE
IT IS A MATTER OF CHOICE
I WILL BE DONE WITH WORK BY THE END OF THE DAY
IF I WOULD JUST WORK ALL DAY LONG
I WILL WORK PART TIME TO PAY FOR MY COLLEGE
SOME OF US WILL STAY AT HOME
BUT IT WAS GREAT PLEASURE WHILE WE DID IT
MY HUSBAND DIDN'T LIKE THAT
THIS IS A FINE CAT
I REALLY ENJOY THAT
SOMETIMES IT CAN BE GOOD
THESE BEHAVIORS ARE ACCEPTABLE AND THESE ARE NOT
I MEAN I DO GO TO CHURCH AND THINGS
I THINK THEY NEED THAT
THEN IT WOULD DEFINITELY AFFECT UNEMPLOYMENT
YOU AND I ARE TESTED FOR THE VIRUS
EVERYONE GROWS UP AND GETS MORE MATURE
ARE YOU A CONTRACTOR OR AN EMPLOYEE
SHE THOUGHT LONG AND HARD ABOUT THIS DECISION
TALK TO YOUR FAVOURITE TEACHERS FIRST
WHAT HAD GONE ON
HOW MUCH DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS
ARE YOU RIGHT HERE
THEY ARE RIGHT
LOCAL BOY RAISES MONEY FOR HEADSTONE OF FRIEND
YOUR VOICE SEEMS BETTER NOW
I CHANGED THAT
I WOULDN'T VOTE FOR THEM ANYMORE
YOU NEVER GET A CHANCE TO READ
WHEN YOU HAVE CHILDREN
I HOPE IT IS GOOD
SOMETHING LOOKS A LITTLE NICER
WHO WAS THAT WITH
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK
I HAVE PREFERENCES ABOUT THIS SUBJECT
THE OTHER DRIVER WAS KILLED IN THE COLLISION
YOU ALL ARE WAITING FOR THAT
THIS IS TOO LITTLE FOR ALL OF US
SHE IS GETTING MORE WRINKLES ON HER FACE AS SHE AGES
I GUESS I LIKE A VARIETY OF THINGS
THIS WAS TWENTY YEARS AGO
IT STILL LOOKED REAL NICE
IMPROVED EVASION DOES NOT WORK
IT REALLY MAKES IT EASIER
HE GOES TO THE PISTOL RANGE
YOU MUST BE VERY BUSY
NOISE CAUSES AIR POLLUTION
I WILL JOIN YOU AFTER A COUPLE OF DAYS
I USED TO BELONG TO A CHRISTMAS CLUB
WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY NEXT POINT
MY HUSBAND RATHER FINDS IT FUNNY
I HAVE A BROTHER IN HIS TWENTIES
I GUESS IT'S WHAT THEY CALL A STORY AND A HALF
YES IT IS GOODBYE
ATTORNEYS CARE ABOUT JUSTICE
DENTS IN THE HOLE
DID YOU ACTUALLY USE DRUGS AT ALL
MILWAUKEE AREA
HOW MANY YEARS DID IT TAKE
THE CITY MANAGER
THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE ARE GREAT
IT'S AKING PROFITS
WE STILL HAVE TOMATOES
PLEASE READ THIRTY TO FIFTY PAGES A DAY
WHO'S YOUR FAVOURITE COOK
IT WAS A VERY CLOSE GAME
WHAT IS MY ROLE IN THIS PROJECT
A GREAT NUMBER OF PEOPLE WORK ON SUNDAYS
DON'T YOU HATE THAT
I HAVEN'T EVER USED THAT
AND IF I AM LOOKING FOR ENTERTAINMENT USUALLY I GO OUT
I'D LIKE TO TRY THAT AS WELL
I DO NOT DO IT LIKE THAT
I SEE THAT PEOPLE ARE ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT IT
I DO NOT FEEL HUNGRY
IT GREW RATHER SOON INTO A BIG COMPANY
THEY'RE ALL PRETTY GOOD
SO HE KIND OF WAS A COWBOY TYPE
IN THAT TIME FRAME
A WHOLE NEW WORLD
THERE IS MUCH MORE CRIME THAN EVER BEFORE
TELL MY FAMILY I DO NOT FEEL THIRSTY
EXCEPT YOU GET TO TASTE THE PRODUCT INSTEAD
I CAN HEAR MYSELF AND MY FRIENDS IN THIS ROOM
OUR PROBLEMS ARE NOT VERY BIG AS THEIR PROBLEM
DO I TELL YOU
THAT DOES NOT SIT VERY WELL WITH A LOT OF FOLKS
I DIDN'T CATCH YOUR NAME AT FIRST
THEY'RE VERY VOCAL
I'M NOT ALTOGETHER SURE THAT THAT'S MY BEST TOPIC
THEY'VE DONE IT BEFORE
WHAT KIND OF STUFF WOULD THEY ENJOY
OUR YARD IS SO SMALL
WHICH I THINK IS AWFUL
YOU ARE THE ONE WHO SIGNED UP FOR IT
THIS APPLIES TO THE PEOPLE WHO ENJOY GAMING
MIKE WAS THE GUNNER OF THE CONVOY
CHILDREN ARE GOING TO PLAY CARDS
A ROUTINE LIKE AT
YOU KNOW WHAT I WOULD LOVE RIGHT ABOUT NOW
I HOPE YOU DO OKAY
WE WERE HEAVY INTO AFFIRMATIVE ACTION
I DON'T THINK I'LL DO IT AGAIN
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS YOUR PRIMARY CAUSE OF IT
PLEASE DO NOT REMAIN UNDER THE ILLUSION THAT YOU ARE SAFE
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO MOVE FAST
HE JUST THOUGHT I WAS LOOKING FOR MY DOG
HAVE FAITH
DO YOU PAINT OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
PAPER CUT IS NOT THE BEST
YOU TAKE CARE
NO IT'S A TALKING POINT
EVEN IF I HAVE MY DOG WITH ME
IS THIS SOME SORT OF A DISEASE
IT WAS ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE YEARS AGO
I WANT TO TAKE MY DOG FOR A WALK
TELL MY FAMILY HOW YOU DO IT
YOU SHOULD LISTEN TO THIS YOURSELF
IT'S VERY EASY FOR ANYBODY TO LOOK YOU UP
IT WAS NEVER VERY INTUITIVE TO ME
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A DETERRENT TO CRIME
THIS STORY SOUNDS VERY FUNNY
WE JUST DON'T PROTECT THEM
THESE WERE SOVIET MADE
COMPOSER SECTION
CHAR ONION OVER GRILL NEVER ALLOW OIL TO SMOKE
IT ALWAYS SOUNDED
WHAT DO YOU DO HERE
I THOUGHT UTAH WAS COLD
SOME ARE FOUND TUCKED AWAY IN TOILET STALLS
MAKE A CHOICE AND LEAVE IT IN THE COMMENTS
I CAN FIX THIS IN FIFTEEN MINUTES
YOUR ROLE AND EXPERIENCE
HE HAD TO STAY HOME
WE USED TO TRY TO GET TOGETHER
THEIR EXPERIENCE WAS SO BAD
THEY COULD HAVE HAD A LOTTERY
YOU CAN ALWAYS SAY NO THANK YOU
FROM OUR DAILY ROUTINE
IT'S TOUGH ON THE JOINTS IF YOU JOG ON CONCRETE
WHAT KIND OF NOISE IS THAT
I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO STAND ON IT
THEY ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN
TELL MY FAMILY I AM NOT HUNGRY
ARE THEY VERY HUNGRY
SHE WENT TO COLLEGE IN ANOTHER COUNTRY
YOU ARE NOT TIRED
I WOULD LOVE TO SEE MY FAMILY SOON
WHO SAID THESE CHOICES WERE EASY
THAT'S NOT HELPFUL
THAT'S A SERIOUS PICKUP TRUCK
WHICH MOVIE DID YOU WATCH
IT LOOKS LIKE IT WOULD BE A LOT OF FUN
I HAD TO WALK ALONG THE HIGHWAY
DO YOU HAVE IT RIGHT
I CATCH MYSELF WATCHING THIS SHOW QUITE OFTEN
A GOOD SOUTHERN SOLUTION
MY DOG IS DOING FINE WITH MY FRIEND
THE CHILDREN ARE THE VICTIMS
YOU'D THINK YOU WOULD BE
THE PUBLIC'S SPLIT ON IT
I WAS GOING TO SAY
IS MY FAMILY COMING CLOSER
IT SEEMS LIKE HE WOULD DEVELOP PRIDE
THE MORE LOCAL ELECTIONS
MAKING ENOUGH MONEY IS ALSO IMPORTANT
WHAT I'M USING NOW IS JAMAICAN CURRY POWDER
HOPE YOU FEEL OKAY
I HAVE NO IDEA HOW MANY
ALL THAT BEGAN BACK THERE
SHE SAID UNABLE TO KEEP THE PAIN FROM HER VOICE
WELL I'M DEFINITELY GOING FOR IT
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THAT JUST THE OTHER DAY
IT FELT THAT WE HAVE KNOWN EACH OTHER FOR A LONG TIME
BUT HE'S BEEN KIND OF UP AND DOWN ALL YEAR
WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING RIGHT NOW
RUSSELL ULTIMATELY MARRIED HIS BOYFRIEND
HE'S RETIRED NOW
VENEZUELA HAS THE WORLD'S LARGEST OIL RESERVES
MY COMPANY HAS PAID ALL TAXES ON TIME
DO YOU HAVE THAT
FOR A CHECKUP OR WHATEVER
HE'S A BLACK MAN
A LITTLE CLOSER TO THE EDGE
LIBERALS AS USUAL ARE WRONG ON EVERYTHING
HAVE LITTLE MATERIAL LUXURY BUT WANT A LOT MORE
THE JOY OF THE WEEKEND WITH FAMILY IS SOMETHING ELSE
OKAY IT IS NOT THAT BAD
SMALL CARS MAKE LESS NOISE
DESPERATE TIMES DESPERATE MEASURES
DO NOT
WE HAVE A LOT OF FOOD AT HOME
HE'S A PROPONENT OF THAT
THE AMOUNT OF WORK DEPENDS ON YOUR FIELD
WHERE IT IS
VERY GOOD HERE
I WAS SURPRISED AT THE ENDING
LIBERAL ARTS PROGRAMS ARE A GOOD IDEA
I THINK THAT'S REGRESSIVE
YOU COULD RECORD IT
TEAMS THAT THEY'VE ALREADY BEAT THIS YEAR
DEPENDING ON THE MOISTURE CONTENT
CHOICE
I'M A RADIO PERSON I GUESS IS WHAT I MEAN
WE ARE GETTING OLD AND WORK IS ALSO GETTING HARD
AND THEY REALLY SEEM WISE
I THINK THAT IS A VERY WRONG WAY TO HANDLE
AMERICAN FAMILIES ARE QUITE SOCIAL
DOWNLOAD ON YOUR COMPUTER OR TELEVISION
HE MAKES IT A LITTLE BIT EASIER FOR HER
I HOPE THEY DO IT
GOODBYE PLEASE
I WAS JUST JOKING AROUND
I HAVE READ THIS BOOK HUNDRED TIMES
WE'VE ALWAYS GONE TO A LOT OF MOVIES IN OUR LIFE
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE I ENJOY EVERY MOMENT
I'VE FOUND SOME DOCTORS
I THINK HOSPITALS MAKE A TON OF MONEY
HAVE YOU CALLED HER ABOUT YOUR CAR YET
I WOULD PERSONALLY BE THE LAST RESORT
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT A COUPLE OF THINGS
I THINK GOING AWAY FOR SIX WEEKS MAKES SENSE
THEY DO IT
YES I AM HUNGRY
I AM TALKING TO THE CHILDREN
YOU HAVE TO CUT EACH ONE
I WOULD RATHER AVOID TAKING MY BABY THERE
THIS IS MY FAVORITE PLACE TO WATCH THE SUNSET
SOME TYPES OF AGREEMENTS TO LIMIT
MY MOM AND DAD GOT IT SET UP
THE PRICE IS FORTY DOLLARS EVERY TWO WEEKS
BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN RECYCLING FOR QUITE SOME TIME
I MEAN I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE TO START
I TURNED MINE IN ABOUT TWELVE HOURS EARLY AT NOON
I WOULD RECONSIDER WHERE I WAS BUYING IT
WE DON'T EVER CATCH ENOUGH TO EAT
I HAVE NOT SEEN THIS YET
JUST IN HOUSE PROGRAMS TO DO WHAT THEY NEEDED
I MET ANOTHER GENTLEMAN AT THE MEETING
I'LL BE DONE THIS AFTERNOON
DO YOU WANT SOME WATER
YES YOU HAVE IT
GOVERNMENT CHANGED THIS POLICY
WHAT ARE YOU DOING NEXT WEEK
FAITH IS OKAY
I WORK IN FACILITIES AND I HAPPEN TO HAVE THE KEY WITH ME
YOU DO NOT HAVE MY SUCCESS
MY FATHER OWNS A RESTAURANT
THE MONEY SPEAKS FOR US
POUR THAT IN THE SINK
EITHER THIS OR THAT
YOU ARE RIGHT ON POINT
SHOULD WE GO OVER THE COMPANY BUDGET
I AM TIRED ARE YOU
I SAW WHAT LOOKED LIKE A FIGHT
SHE LIVES IN A NURSING HOME
I WANT TO SEE WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT
UNDERGRADUATE SCHOOL
A LOT OF TRIPS INVOLVED GOING TO VISIT
I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE
SUBSCRIBE TO THE THINGS I'M INTERESTED IN
WE SHOULD GO TOGETHER TO FIND HIM
DID YOU SEE ANY OF THOSE NEW CARS
DRAWING PAINTING AND THE VISUAL ARTS
THIS LARGE SPACE IS NOT FOR TRASH
MURDER IS A CRIME
BECAUSE I DIDN'T DECIDE TO MAJOR IN THAT UNTIL A FEW YEARS LATER
IT'S INVESTMENT PROPERTY
THAN HE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE
I TEACH AT A PUBLIC SCHOOL
AND IT EVOKES AN EMOTIONAL RESPONSE
THEY ARE BAD
SHE HEARD ANOTHER NOISE COMING FROM THE GYM
SHE JUST GOT A GREEN CARD
THAT'S WHY YOU WANT TO JOIN
THERE STILL HASN'T BEEN ANY SIGN OF RAIN TODAY
WHERE WAS THAT AT
YOU BRING IT CLOSER
VERY HIGH MARKUPS ON ALL ITEMS
THIS PAST WINTER WAS VERY COLD
WE'RE RENTING A HOUSE
I LIKE TO OWN LESS STUFF
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL HOME
LAY IT TO DRY UNDER THE SUN
TELEVISION NEWS STATIONS SHOWED A MORE COMPLEX STORY
THEN IT WON'T BE TOO BAD
I GUESS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EXERCISE
ARE THEY OKAY
HOW DID YOU DECIDE WHAT TO DO
I DO NOT HAVE MY GLASSES
THEY'RE ALWAYS SAYING THAT SOMEBODY IS GOING
CHECK IF THE AIR IS CLEAN
THE DAFFODILS ARE OUT
POWER WILL BE OFF FOR AN HOUR
IT'S AN OLDER PLACE
EVERYBODY HAS THAT SAME MIND SET
WHERE IS IT GOING TO BE
SALAD DRESSING BOTTLES AND THINGS LIKE THAT
THEY WENT AWAY FOR A LONG TIME
THE WHOLE THING WENT AWAY JUST LIKE THAT
ARE YOU SOMEONE WHO WORKS OUTSIDE YOUR HOME
I'D JUST AS SOON A LOT FEWER PEOPLE DID
MAKE UNIFORMS FOR THE KIDS
I GUESS I HAVE TO RETURN SOMETHING AT THE STORE
THE GLASS WINDOWS ARE DIRTY
IT WOULD JUST DEPEND
I HOPE YOU THINK I AM DOING A GOOD JOB WITH THIS
I USUALLY PUT GARLIC POWDER IN MINE
AND WE PLAY OUT HERE IN THE SUMMERTIME
YOU ARE CLOSER
I HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOICE MY OPINION
IT IS WAY TOO SALTY
I JUST FLAT DIDN'T SPEND ANY MONEY
MY HOPE IS MY SUCCESS
A LOT OF IT GOES DOWN TO JUST MONEY
I DON'T ENVY THESE YOUNG PARENTS
I WAS CLEAR THAT THIS IS CERTAINLY WRONG
PLEASE TELL MY NURSE I AM GOING UP
THEY PROBABLY LIVE IN A CITY ALSO
IT WAS UNUSUAL TO SAY THE LEAST
I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO MAKE IT MANDATORY
I'VE ALWAYS ENJOYED DOING IT BY MYSELF
JUST SOMETHING FUN TO DO
I LIKED IT A LITTLE BIT BUT I DIDN'T
WE RAISE IT UP TO THE SEVENTIES
THAT WAS A PRETTY DELICATE THING TO DO
WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE CITY FIRST
INTO HACKING OR WHATEVER
ONCE YOU GET SOMETHING FANCY
THAT WAS ONE MOVIE I CAME OUT IMPRESSED
THEY DO NOT HAVE MY COMPUTER
WHICH WAS A CLASS SOMETHING FELONY
HOW ARE THEY THIRSTY
AVOID THIS COLLEGE COURSE
YES I AM VERY GOOD
WE CAN'T SEE IT CAN YOU
TRY TO CATCH ONE OF THE MORNING TALK SHOWS
IT'S JUST SO VERSATILE
IF I DON'T HAVE A REEL WITH A BUTTON ON IT
HE HAS THE SAME THING THAT ALL MY KIDS HAVE
IN THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY
A REALLY IMPORTANT THING TO ME IS WHEN THEY WOULD COME
SHE THOUGHT IT WAS RIVETING
YOU MIGHT WANT TO ATTACK THE ENEMY
I AM NOT TIRED
IT TAKES A LIFETIME
PUBLIC RELATIONS
IT'S SITUATIONAL
I THINK WE PUT TOO MUCH ON POLITICIANS
THIS JOB GIVES ME SO MUCH JOY
I HOPE I AM THIRSTY
THAT'S TOO MUCH TROUBLE
CLEARLY THIS GUY IS TRYING TO MAKE A POINT
I RODE A FERRY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE
I'M DYING TO SEE THAT
I GOT SOME GOOD EXERCISE
THEY'RE SO MANY MORE
ALEX IS VERY CALCULATING IN MAKING HIS DECISIONS
I'VE SEEN HER DO IT
IT GETS RID OF SOME OF THE CONFUSION
DO NOTHING
I LOVE MY SMALL DOG
I STILL CARE ABOUT MY OLD STUFF
YOU WHAT
LAST WEEK WE GOT A LOT OF RAIN
MY FAMILY IS NOT GOING OUTSIDE
IN THE SHOW THEY HAVE SUPER POWERS
HOW IS IT REALLY TRANSMITTED
I HAVE SIX YEARS OF COLLEGE
IT TAKES YEARS TO MAKE BIG MONEY
SPORTS IS THEIR BIGGEST BUSINESS
EVEN THESE BUSES
AVOID ROUTINE
NOT LIKE THE EAGLE
THEY WERE ELECTED TO THE COMMITTEE
BRING MY COMPUTER REPORT PLEASE
FOUR HUNDRED DOESN'T QUITE FEEL LIKE A CHOICE
I LIKE CLASSICAL MUSIC
THAT'S BECAUSE HE'S PROBABLY DOING WHAT I DO
WHAT KIND OF MUSIC DO YOU ENJOY
I WILL SAY THIS ONLY ONCE
IF HE CAN KEEP THE BAND TOGETHER
YOU KNOW THAT'S HURTING US
THEY ARE OVER THERE I CAN SEE THEM
AVOID THIRD PARTY APPS
WHAT DO YOU NEED
THE BEST YOU CAN DO
NEED IT
I WILL BE VISITING NEW ENGLAND
YOU CAN USE IT HOWEVER YOU WANT TO
SHE WAS BORN THE VERY NEXT DAY
ONE MORE YEAR HAS GONE
I'M IN FAVOR OF DOING VERY LITTLE CLEAN UP
AT SOME POINT IT'S GOING TO GET MORE EXPENSIVE
I MEAN YOU HAVE TO SET AN EXAMPLE
YES I DO FEEL TIRED
WHATEVER IT WAS
WELL HE DOES NOT USUALLY DRINK HE SAYS
HE IS PROBABLY ABOUT FIFTY THREE YEARS OLD NOW
I CAN HEAR YOUR VOICE
IT WASN'T CREATIVE AT ALL
WHAT'S AMERICA'S ROLE IN THE CONFLICT
I WORK OUT BEFORE I GO TO WORK
IT'S A FORTY YEAR OLD HOUSE
WE NEED MORE GOOD SCHOOLS AROUND HERE
SHE GOT IT JUST NOW FOR YOU
DO YOU GO LIKE HOME COOKING
I WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME THING
I CAN FINISH IT IN A DAY
THEY HOPE I AM CLOSER
THAT'S WHY I LIKE SOME DIVERSITY IN MY BREAKFAST FOOD
THERE ARE THREE TYPES OF MEASURES YOU CAN TAKE
A COUPLE OF CHILDREN AND WE HAVE TO
IT'S A CASUAL WORKING SPACE
HOWEVER THAT DECISION WAS OVERTURNED ON APPEAL
I AM IN MIDDLE OF THE SERVICE
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THIS
THERE IS SOME DANGER TO THAT
YOU WILL SEE THEM IN MANAGEMENT
I NEED TO LOOK INTO IT MORE
THEY LIKE MY FAMILY
I WATCH THE NEWS ON TELEVISION
THROUGH TO THE SYSTEM
NEED HELP HERE
AFTER THAT IT WAS THE INTERIOR STAIRS AND FOYER
IS MY MUSIC GOOD
MY MUSIC IS MY HOPE
MAYBE EIGHTEEN INCHES
OTHERS WILL NOT HAVE ANY POWER OVER THIS
THE SHOW HAS CHANGED MY LIFE IMMEASURABLY
FOUR YEAR OLD SUBARU AND A TWO YEAR OLD HONDA
DESPITE ALL OF OUR OPEN SPACE OUT HERE
I WOULD LIKE MY NEXT CAR TO HAVE GOOD GAS MILEAGE
SHE WAS IN THERE FIRST
THEY MOVED IT FROM TUESDAY NIGHT TO WEDNESDAY NIGHT
WHAT DOES HE DO FOR WORK
IT DEPENDS ON DIFFERENT PLACES
WELL I FELL IN LOVE WITH THIS
I WILL WAIT FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS BEFORE CALLING BACK
I'VE SEEN MUCH MORE THAN THIS
AIR CAN COST US MONEY IN THE FUTURE
I'M ALL FOR THAT
THE COMMENTARIES
WHICH BRINGS US TO LEGACY OF THE VOID
IT'S OUR OWN FAULT BECAUSE WE ELECTED THEM
WHAT KIND OF CAR DOES EVERYBODY DRIVE UP THERE
THEN PAY IT AT THE END OF THE MONTH
THIS STORY IS NOT EXACTLY FUNNY
YOU SHOULD FEEL VERY GOOD ABOUT THIS
YOU HOPE THEY ARE OKAY
I DON'T CARE ABOUT THIS
ALL OF US LIKE THIS A LOT
WE'VE TRAVELED FAIRLY CHEAPLY BEFORE
NOW IN CRIMINAL I GUESS YOU ALWAYS HAVE A JURY
I WILL HAVE TO MEASURE IF THIS IS DIFFERENT
I HAVEN'T USED IT YET
IT'S THAT GRANDMOTHER FIGURE
THEY CLASSIFY MOST OF THEM AS PROFESSIONALS
OR IT IS NOT ON THE BREATHING MACHINE IS NOT ON
YOU ARE NOT CLEAN
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THIS CHOICE
THE RECYCLE ONES ARE BETTER TO USE
I LIKE THAT
WHAT DOES YOUR HEART SAY ABOUT THIS
I TEND TO LISTEN TO THE CLASSICAL MUSIC
I DIDN'T USED TO BUT NOW I EAT CEREAL EVERY MORNING
QUARANTINE MEASURES WERE NOT SEEN AS NECESSARY
YOU GET ALL PREPARED BUT YOU'RE RIGHT
I WAS THINKING THAT IT WILL BE OKAY
I DON'T THINK TOO MANY OF THEM ARE THERE ANYMORE
MY DREAM CAR FOR YEARS
THE MONTHLY PAYMENT WAS PAID ON TIME
THE COUPLE IS TRYING TO MAKE THIS LAST FOR YEARS TO COME
THAT'S REAL SCARY
I STOPPED PAYMENT ON A CHECK
I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE SHE WAS MATURE ENOUGH SOCIALLY
YOUR NEW HOUSE IS VERY NICE
THIS JOB WILL END IN FOUR YEARS
OR MAYBE YOUR DAUGHTER
EVERY TIME I COME IN
CHICKEN BEEF AND THAT KIND OF STUFF
IT'S USUALLY WORTH SOMETHING LATER ON
HE WAS NOT THE STAR
IF YOU DON'T MIND READING SUBTITLES
OUR COMPANY DOES SOME GOOD THINGS
WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO OUR BUSINESS
MIGHT MAKE A GOOD SALAD
IT SEEMS THAT WE'VE MADE OUR DECISION
WHAT KIND OF VACATIONS DO YOU LIKE
THAT'S EXACTLY THE WAY HE FEELS
OF COURSE THE STORE IS VERY CLOSE
WHAT WOULD YOU BUY
THAT JUST ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED TO DO NOW
IT'S BEEN A FEW YEARS
I FOUND IT HARD TO DEAL WITH
MY FAMILY IS CLOSER
THE CHILDREN LOVE THEM
IN THE VIETNAM WAR IT SEEMS LIKE WE LOST FOCUS
DO YOU LIKE THAT
I KNEW YOU WERE READING THIS BOOK
I HAVE A BROTHER WHO SPENT TWO YEARS IN BOLIVIA
FOR THE BOTH OF US
WE FIND SOMETHING WE LIKE
MY NURSE IS NOT GOING
I HAVE SOMETHING TO SHOW YOU
WHICH I ALSO HAD DONE THE YEAR BEFORE
THERE IS A LONG WAY BETWEEN NOW AND THAT POINT
GOOD MUSIC COMES WITH A GREAT COST
I DO QUITE A BIT OF BUSINESS IN WASHINGTON
IT ENDS UP BURNING
I WAS MUCH YOUNGER
AREN'T THEY PLAYING DETROIT
GOT TO SEE PIKE'S PEAK
IT WAS VERY NICE TO SEE YOU
I DO IT BY MYSELF IN A GROUP OF MAYBE FORTY OR SO
ANOTHER MONTH WENT BY JUST LIKE THAT
IT'S JUST SO MUCH WEIGHT LIFTING
WE'RE ALSO GOING THROUGH ADOPTION NOW
I DON'T KNOW
LET ME TELL YOU MY REAL NAME
THEY PUT THEM UPSIDE DOWN
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE NEW MOVIE TRAILER
SALES I FIND ARE A PAIN
WHAT WILL HAPPEN ON THE WEEKEND
HAVING THIS IDEA SEEMS VERY EASY
WHAT KIND OF CAR DO YOU WANT TO BUY
WE'RE GETTING READY TO GO
THEY HAD SEASON TICKETS
WHICH COLLEGE PROGRAM HAVE YOU LOOKED AT
IF IT GOES DOWN
WHERE IS THE TREASURE BURIED
IT WASN'T ALL THAT MUCH
THE QUALIFIED PEOPLE
I CERTAINLY CAN'T ARGUE WITH THAT
MY LITTLE GIRL GOES TO TAP DANCE LESSONS
WE DON'T HAVE ANY SNOW HERE NOW
THE ONLY THING WE'RE KNOWN FOR
I DO NOT NEED IT
DOES IT COST THE SAME FOR JUST TWO NIGHTS
ALUMINUM FOIL HAS A SHINY SIDE AND A DULL SIDE
EXERCISE IS NOT SUPPOSED TO DO THAT TO YOU
NO PLEASE I AM TIRED
AROUND WHERE I LIVE
I HOPE THEY ARE NOT HERE
SHE HASN'T TALKED TO ANYBODY
WE BOUGHT EVERYTHING IN A GROCERY STORE
I DON'T REMEMBER WHICH OTHER ONE IT WAS
I'M REALLY ENJOYING IT
I LIKE THAT ONE TOO
YOU COULD HARDLY WAIT
THE IMMUNE SYSTEM CAN AT FIRST SLOW DOWN
AROUND THIS TIME OF THE YEAR
THIS IS JUST A STARTING POINT
HOPE YOU ARE COMFORTABLE
SOME PEOPLE ARE GOING TO
ONLY FIVE DAYS TO GO
THIS IS A GREAT PLACE TO LIVE
IF I PUT MY MIND TO IT
WATER HERE LOOKS DIFFERENT
YOU SAY IT IS ALL VOLUNTEER WORK
HOW TIRED ARE YOU
EMPLOYEES ARE WORTH MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE
THIS PLACE NEEDS A CHANGE
IT THINK IT'S JAMAICA
AVOIDING THE WORST FLIGHTS FOR TURBULENCE
ALL ALLEGED DEMOCRATS
I FEEL LIKE THAT
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED HE COULD GET AWAY WITH IT
HOW THIRSTY ARE YOU
I HAD SOMEONE TELL ME THAT
CLEAN THAT UP
I SEE HER ONLY ONCE OR TWICE A YEAR
I LIKE ALL KINDS OF BOOKS
ACCORDING TO THE FOLLOWING UTTERANCE
I FEEL WE COULD DO MUCH MORE
WE BELIEVE IT IS THE BEST DECISION
JUST ABOUT ANY KIND OF MUSIC
I DON'T COMPLAIN WEATHER WISE THOUGH
HE SEEMED TO KNOW WHAT HE WAS DOING
I HOPE THEY ARE OKAY
HOWEVER NO CASUALTIES WERE REPORTED
SHE WAS A DOG THAT LOVED TO RUN
IT IS IN THE URBAN AREAS
AND I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY DO THAT
I HAVE SEEN A BIG CHANGE
YOU MUST GO NOW YOU ARE ALREADY LATE
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW THE TERRITORY AT ALL
YOU CAN SEE QUITE A FEW DIFFERENT ANIMALS AT THE ZOO
THEY'RE WELCOME TO GO SOME PLACE ELSE
I TOOK MY KIDS OUT AND TAUGHT THEM HOW TO GO BACKPACKING
BUT THEY NEVER SAY WHO
I WILL TAKE A LARGE PIECE OF THIS FOOD
EVERYONE WILL READ THIS NEWSPAPER TOMORROW
I AM KIND OF A HOBBYIST
STRAIGHT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL
CARRY IT OVER TO THERE
WHAT MAKES IT INTERESTING IS THAT WE ARE ALL DIFFERENT
I WOULDN'T WANT THEM TO BE ON DRUGS
MANATEES ARE OFTEN FATALLY INJURED IN COLLISIONS WITH BOATS
FOR TWO YEARS WE DIDN'T
WHERE DO YOU HAVE TO DO A WHOLE BUNCH OF WORK
THAT'S THE ONE I WATCH
I WILL GET ALL OF THIS DONE
HAWAII IS MY FAVORITE STATE
I DON'T REALLY CARE THAT MUCH FOR THE TROUT
ARE YOU GOOD
IT CAME OUT IN THE THEATER
THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DO
THE STORES THAT SELL
I DON'T READ AS MUCH AS I WOULD LIKE TO EITHER
THEY ARE NOT CLEAN
I MAINLY LEAVE THAT UP TO THEM
IT'S USUALLY OKAY WITH ME
SPACE OUTSIDE BIGGEST STORE IS EXPENSIVE
WE TRY TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME ON THE WEEKEND
THEY WERE GIVEN A THIRTY DAY NOTICE TO VACATE
IS THAT PUTTING TOO FINE A POINT ON IT
OUTSIDE HELP
I WILL GO THERE NOW
THE LAND WAS PAID FOR WITH CASH
HOW ARE THEY COMING UP
WE GO TO THEIR HOUSE REGULARLY
I LIKE MINIATURE POODLES AND OTHER SMALL DOGS
THEY HAVE NO NEED
I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR THAT
I'VE HEARD THEY'RE TERRIBLE
OUR PROBLEMS WILL GO AWAY
MY DAUGHTER WILL RECORD HER MUSIC FOR THE FAMILY
WE'VE ACTUALLY GOT KIND OF A NICE SET UP
SHE GAVE ME A NUMBER OF BOOKS
WHEN I WAS YOUNGER WE'D GO THERE EVERY WEEKEND
I HAVE FOUR CHILDREN
IT IS SUCH A WONDERFUL STORY TO TELL
THEY LIVE ACROSS THE STREET FROM US
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THIS IS INTERESTING
THE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN
DIDN'T MEAN TO CUT YOU OFF THERE
HELLO IS IT YES
I LIKE THE EARLY MORNING HOURS
SHE WENT TO A MORE EXPENSIVE COLLEGE
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING IMPORTANT
I JUST LIKE GETTING OUT OF THE HOUSE
THEY TAKE IT OUT OF YOUR SALARY BEFORE TAXES
WE'VE BEEN THERE ONCE AT NIGHT ON CHRISTMAS
TELL MY FAMILY THEY FEEL HUNGRY
HOW ABOUT POPULAR MUSIC
EVERYTHING'S REALLY EXPENSIVE HERE
I CERTAINLY SOLD BOOKS TO A FRIEND FOR HIS EDUCATION
LOOKING AT VISIONS OF THE FUTURE
I COULDN'T TELL YOU WHO PITCHED IN THAT GAME
THEIR MOTHER'S MAIDEN NAME
THE MINUTE I SAID THE WORD
YOU GET MIXED SIGNALS
BASICALLY HAVE A INDEPENDENT LIFE STYLE
THERE IS A SMALL HOUSE AT THE END OF THIS STREET
I DO NOT LIKE MUSIC
WHAT DO YOU THINK ARE SOME CURRENT TRENDS
THERE'S QUITE A FEW
DO YOU REALLY THINK THIS IS TRUE
YES I CAN HEAR YOU
I THINK THAT WILL BE GOOD
THAT SOUNDS LIKE FUN
SHE PLANS IT ALL OUT
DO YOU LIKE YOUR NEW WATCH
WHO CAN SCREAM LOUDER
AND IT WASN'T
IT STILL MAKES MOST OF ITS PROFIT IN ASIA
THIS CAMPING FIELD IS VERY CLEAN
THIS WAS IN THE COURSE PROGRAM
FOOTBALL IS AN EXCITING SPORT
YOU NEED TO REALLY RELAX
THIS GUY WILL MOSTLY SELL THIS ART FOR CREDIT
THEY HAD THIS INVASION IN MIND FOR QUITE A WHILE
NOBODY COULD FIGURE IT OUT
I SEE AT LEAST TWO A WEEK
THEY'RE ALWAYS SURE THEY GOT THE RIGHT GUY
MAYBE THERE WILL BE ANOTHER CHANCE
I WILL WALK THE DOG IN THE EVENING
I THINK MY FAVORITE MEAL WAS A HAMBURGER AND FRIES
I REALLY LIKE IT
WE GOT PRETTY LUCKY WITH THAT
IT MAY BE OTHER NATURAL THINGS AT WORK
LET'S WAIT FOR THEM OUTSIDE IN THE SUN
EVEN THE GENERATION BEFORE ME KNEW THAT
I AM TRYING TO CONVINCE HIM TO WRITE ALL THIS DOWN
AT THE HIGHER ECHELONS
THE DRUG PROBLEM IS GETTING WORSE
YOU KNOW YOU CAN TALK TO ME ABOUT THIS
I DO NOT HAVE MUCH TO COMPARE IT TO
SHE'S MET THEM ALREADY
KIDS ARE NOT ALONE IN THE HOUSE
MY MOTHER WILL ORDER THIS AHEAD OF TIME
OF COURSE
DO YOU HAVE IT COMING
I HOPE I HAVE MY FAITH
THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO CONVINCE ME
SOMEONE WILL LET YOU IN SOON
TO GRILL SOME FLOUNDER OR SALMON STEAKS
WE STILL HAVE A LOT OF PRIVACY
LOCAL PEOPLE ARE VERY KIND
I'M SITTING OUT HERE RIGHT NOW
ONCE EVERY YEAR OR TWO
FINDING AN EXPLOIT TO EXPLOIT
I WAS ON THE JURY THAT SENTENCED HIM
CHECK OUT THE FULL SPOILERS HERE
THIS WILL NOT WIN YOU ANY POINTS
IT'S AFFECTING THE FAMILIES YOU KNOW
IT IS SUCH A WONDERFUL DAY
WHAT HAPPENS IF I MISS THE OCCASIONAL DOSE OF MEDICINE
AND THE SKUNK WAS A GOOD STORY
ORDER OUR REGULAR TODAY
I HOPE YOU HAVE
PRECISELY MY POINT
I LIVE IN MY OWN LITTLE WORLD
SENT OUT A SURVEY
I KNOW THERE IS
GOING GOOD
THERE ARE NO REAL RECYCLING FACILITIES
THAT WOULD REALLY WARRANT CAPITAL PUNISHMENT
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME
I USE MY PERSONAL COMPUTER CONSTANTLY
I WORK FOR THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION
THEY HOPE YOU ARE GOING
DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
THE POLICE SAID THAT THE BOY'S INJURIES WERE MINOR
THEY OCCASIONALLY HOLD EVENTS
PLEASE HAVE THEM PICK UP AROUND THE SCHOOL YARD
LEAVE IT TO SOMEBODY WHO DOES IT FOR A LIVING
ONLY FEW PEOPLE HAVE SEEN THIS SHOW
THAT HADN'T CROSSED MY MIND
RIGHT HAND  CLOSE
HOW OUR POLITICIANS VOTED EACH WEEK IN THE PAPER
I THINK IT IS
AS MANY MILES AS YOU CAN GET OUT OF THAT CAR
I HATE TO SEE A CAR GOING DOWN THE STREET
THEY ARE HERE
THEY REALLY SHOULD NOT BE IN THERE
ARE THESE MISTAKES OF OMISSION OR OUTRIGHT LIES
HE IS NOT A VERY GOOD BOY
IT'S AWFULLY EASY
WE USED TO STIR FRY A LOT
THEY'RE GOING TO GO ON A CRUISE THIS SUMMER
DO YOU PLAY THE PIANO
JUST BEING AROUND YOUNG PEOPLE
READING THIS BOOK GIVES ME GREAT PLEASURE
GOVERNMENT DECISIONS ARE QUITE IMPORTANT
FEW PLACES NOW SEEM TO DO IT BY THE SLICE
WE ALL LIKE MY OLDEST BROTHER
THE OTHER PEOPLE WERE KIND OF MIXED
YOU COULD DO IT
THEY ARE GOING
I HAVE NO HELP
DO IT PLEASE
TWO HOUR CLASSES
I BET THAT WAS FRUSTRATING
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE EVER HEARD OF THEM
MY HAIR IS A MESS
I HOPE THEY ARE HERE
I REMEMBER ONE TIME UP IN NASHVILLE
RUNNING THEIR COUNTRY FOR THEM
YES DEFINITELY I AM IT WAS EVEN STRONGER YESTERDAY I MEAN MORE FREQUENT
I HAVE SEEN THAT BOY BEFORE
WE CAN DO THIS TOGETHER
WHAT AM I THINKING OF
NO MY NURSE IS NOT GOING
WERE YOU TRYING TO FOLLOW ANY TYPE OF RULE
CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT
RENT ALL THE MOVIES THAT YOU LIKE
DO YOU BELIEVE IN YOURSELF
THAT I THINK SHOULD CHANGE
WHICH I'M SURE IS THE PROPER TERM
THE LAST TIME HE CAME WAS IN MARCH
GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR BASEBALL GAME
MAYBE PEOPLE ARE BECOMING MORE AWARE
THAT PLEASED ME
NOT THAT I LIKE READING
IT WAS THE BIG ONE
IT LOOKED TO ME LIKE IT WAS A REAL SUBMARINE
I CLEAN IT
I HAVE NOT BEEN TO SPAIN BEFORE
THEY ARE NOT HERE
WILL YOU COME WITH ME
WE'RE VERY FAR FROM OUR FAMILIES
HOW ABOUT WE GO THERE TOGETHER
JOY SPRINGS FROM A GRATEFUL HEART
HOW IS MY NURSE
THEY JUST DROP IT IN
THE FOOD THERE WAS REALLY OVERPRICED
WHY DID YOU TAKE THIS COURSE
I HAVEN'T BEEN OVER
I WENT TO WORK AS USUAL IN THE MORNING
I JUST FEEL MUCH BETTER
EVERYONE KNOWS HOW TO MAKE TUNA FISH
AT THIS POINT IT'S UP IN THE AIR HE SAID
THESE TEAMS WERE CLEAR FROM THE START
THIS IDEA IS BETTER THAN THE ONE CHILDREN HAD
I DID A LOT OF TALKING WITH MY FRIENDS ABOUT THE SUBJECT
THEY REALLY HADN'T EITHER
I WAS TRYING TO CREATE SOME NEW PROGRAMS
HE WAS INFATUATED BY THAT SKUNK
PUT THEM BY THE CURB
YOU ALSO MANAGE TO MAKE THEM
I DO LIKE HAVING THEM THERE
THE WHOLE MIDDLE EAST IS IN TURMOIL
IT'S THE TALLEST BUILDING ON THE WEST SIDE
I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THIS WORK TAKES TIME
MY BOY WILL GO WITH YOU
THE STATE HAS YET TO APPEAL THAT DECISION
WHY SHOULD I EVEN VOTE
WE USED TO GO OUT
DO YOU NEED HELP
THE NEWS DIVISION OF THE HOUSTON CHRONICLE
I'M GOING TO BE AT THE TOP OF YOUR DIVISION
HOW MUCH TIME HAVE YOU SPENT LIVING IN TEXAS
THE MEASURE NOW HEADS TO THE ILLINOIS HOUSE
HOW WAS YOUR CAMPING EXPERIENCE WITH THE KIDS
EVERYONE NEAR THE CITY LEFT EARLY
I AM TRYING TO LOOK PAST IT BUT I CAN'T
THE BABY IS YOUNG
TWO GIRLS AND TWO BOYS
AT THE VERY LAST MINUTE
IT'S GETTING BUILT UP
I AM USED TO IT BY NOW
AND THEN EVERYTHING WENT AWAY FOR A COUPLE YEARS
NOW I SEE YOU AGAIN ON THIS PROPERTY
WELL MAYBE I'LL GET YOU NEXT TIME
WE HAVE HARD DECISIONS TO MAKE SHE SAID
HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT
I NEED MY NURSE
I CAN START DOING IT IN THE EVENING AFTER WORK
I FEEL LIKE YOU
SHE DIDN'T LIVE WITH US
WE DID THE DRUG TESTING ROUTINE AFTER THAT
I HAVE HEARD IT IS ALL TRUE
YOU ARE NO GOOD
I'VE BEEN IN SCHOOL EVER SINCE
THE YOUNG GIRL
WE SENT SOME OF IT TO OUR FAMILY
ARE YOU HAPPY WITH WHAT YOU ARE DOING NOW
IT'S GOOD TO KNOW THIS
I REALLY LIKE HER VOICE
IT'S JUST A HALF HOUR AWAY
WHEN A TEENAGE BOY COMES INTO HIS MANHOOD
THE LEAVES WERE JUST HORRIBLE LOOKING
THE LOT WE LIVED ON IS NOW A RANCH
DO YOU HAVE MY MUSIC
THERE SHOULD BE SOME MORE HERE
THE HOUSE IS FORTY YEARS OLD
SO WE PUT HERS IN
WALKING SEEMS TO BE THE BEST WAY TO GET AROUND THE NEIGHBORHOOD
THEY'RE ALL AT HOME RIGHT NOW
THIS IS A SEPARATE TOPIC
THEIR SEASONS ARE SWITCHED
WELL NORMALLY WHEN WE GO ON VACATION WE GO AND VISIT HOME
BRING MY GLASSES HERE PLEASE
THEY'RE STARTING OFF
THIS IS UNUSUAL FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE NORTH
IT MAKES YOU REALLY CONCERNED
NOTHING IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN POWER TO THEM
RECENTLY MOVED HERE FROM NORTH CAROLINA
SHE HAS A SON WHO'S A SIXTH GRADER IN MIDDLE SCHOOL
WILL YOU HELP ME WITH MY HOMEWORK
LET THE KIDS PLAY FOR SOME MORE TIME
I'M WATCHING SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE HERE
THEY'RE TESTING THE NEW EQUIPMENT
THEY CAN PRETTY MUCH GET EVERYBODY THERE
I HOPE YOU HAVE A NICE DAY TODAY
I CAN NOT SEE IT GOING ANYWHERE
WE TRIED A PLACE CALLED LOUISIANA PURCHASE
I'VE NEVER BEEN THERE FOR DINNER
I'M GLAD THAT THERE ARE STILL SOME AREAS THAT ARE QUIET
BOTH OF US WILL GO TO THE CITY
WE TURN THE KNOB
WHAT BRINGS YOU TO OUR COMPANY
YES I AM
SOME OLD CHURCH MAGAZINES WERE ON THE TABLE
BUT THEY BOTH HAVE A LOT OF CREDIT CARDS
YOU HAD TO HAVE A SUPPLY
THERE'S NOT MANY HALF HOUR SHOWS
EITHER THAT OR MERCEDES
NURSE IS BAD
HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT IT THAT WAY
KNOWING THAT TO BE TRUE
I GREW UP READING THIS BOOK
THIS IS EVEN BETTER THAN WHAT WE HAD BEFORE
IT DOESN'T ALL HAVE TO BE WHITE
I THINK YOU'LL GET A REAL KICK OUT OF IT
SO THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT
THIS IS A VERY NICE SCHOOL
I LOVE THIS MOVIE TOO
THAT CAN'T BE GOOD FOR LOS ANGELES EITHER
OUR PRINCIPAL SAYS NOT TO HANG OUT IN THE PARKING LOT
COOKING FOODS FOR HER
HOW MUCH SPACE DO YOU HAVE IN YOUR YARD
THIS GUY MAKES BAD CHOICES
I DO FIND IT PARTICULARLY ANNOYING
THIS GUY'S BEATING YOU UP
BECAUSE SHE HAD BEEN CALLED BACK UP
I HOPE THEY ARE CLOSER
THIS WILL BE NEW FOR ME
I HOPE SOMEDAY YOU'LL JOIN US
I DO NOT OWN A CAR
WE CAMPED AT THE DEGRAY STATE PARK IN ARKANSAS
THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE YOU'RE GOING TO GET OFF
I AM BEGINNING TO PANIC BECAUSE I CAN NOT CLEAR MY THROAT
YOU'VE GOT A MODEM IN IT THEN
SO MUCH TO DO AND SO LITTLE TIME
SHE REALLY DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO HANDLE HERSELF
WERE YOU TRYING TO IMPRESS SOMEBODY
TO MAKE THIS WHOLE THING WORK
THEY'RE BANNED FROM GOING TO EUROPE
THEY WERE DOING SOME WORK ON THE OLD HOUSE
I DON'T USE ANY DRUGS
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM GO THROUGH EITHER
THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT IT IS LIKE
DID YOU CARE FOR THAT ONE
WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE CITY COUNCIL
THAT FORCES YOU TO PAY FOR IT
AS FAR AS INCOME TAX IS CONCERNED
EVERYBODY SAYS THAT
MY NURSE IS COMING UP
I HAVE NEVER GONE SKIING BEFORE
TELL ME WHAT TO DO AND I WILL GET IT DONE
NO I DO NOT FEEL HUNGRY
GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR NEW JOB
I WILL ORDER SOME FOOD FOR EVERYONE HERE
I AM A BIG FAN OF HER MUSIC
MY NURSE IS VERY HUNGRY
THEY'RE JUST TOO WEIRD TO WORK ON NOW
I THINK THAT'S THE MAIN PROBLEM AT THIS POINT
IS IT CAYENNE PEPPER
THEY'RE BOTH VERY GOOD
YOU ARE VERY KIND
DO YOU ENJOY THE CONTENT ON THIS BLOG
THAT WORKED FOR A WHILE
IT IS PROBABLY TRUE BUT WE MUST STILL TRY
I WANT TO GO HOME NOW
OR STEEL CURTAIN
GOOD LUCK WITH THE BABY
THE SENIOR CITIZEN'S HOME IS NEARBY
I GUESS I'LL GET BACK TO MY LAUNDRY
HEALTH PLAN FOR HIM
WHAT IS YOUR FAVOURITE CAPITAL CITY
DO NOT CLEAN IT
I GUESS TRAFFIC COULD BE AN ANNOYANCE
I WATCH MYSTERIES TOO
I WILL SORT MY CLOTHES OUT TONIGHT
I TRIED BEING THERE FOR YOU
MY HUSBAND FINALLY GOT HIS BIG FOUR CAR GARAGE
I HOPE YOU HAVE HOPE
YOU DO NOT NEED THAT
WHO TOLD YOU THAT ABOUT ME
OF COURSE I DO
AND THAT'S HAPPENED TO ME MORE THAN ONCE OR TWICE
HELLO DO YOU NEED HELP
THAT'S A POSSIBILITY
IT'S A VERY SHORT DRIVE TO AREAS NEAR HERE
KNOW WHERE TO DRAW A LINE
I AM A DOG PERSON
THEY NEED MY GLASSES
ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE CAME TO LISTEN TO THIS MUSIC
THAT'S A BIG INFLUENCE
I START MY NEW JOB IN MAY
I HAD A BEER AT LUNCH TODAY
COOK WITH MY KIDS
PLEASE BRING IT CLOSER
I REALLY ENJOYED GOING SKIING LAST WINTER
KIDS ARE VERY SOCIAL AT THIS AGE
THAT IS COMING UP
ENVISION THE LIFE THAT YOU WANT TO LIVE
DO A LITTLE BIT BETTER NEXT TIME
THIS WAS NOT AN UNUSUAL REQUEST
THIS IS THE HOUSE OF CARDS
THIS IS STILL QUITE HIGH FOR ME
MY COMPUTER IS NOT GOOD
I LIVE IN A REALLY SMALL APARTMENT
WHAT IS GOING ON IN YOUR HEAD
ON THOSE ISSUES YOU HAVE TO SAY YES OR NO
IT WAS A PRIME TIME FOOTBALL GAME
THAT'S A FUN IDEA
I ENJOYED THIS NEW GAME
SHE WORKS IN THESE FIELDS
I MEAN I GUESS YOU COULD TAKE THOSE OFF TOO
I TYPE UP THE TAPES OF WHAT PEOPLE TALKED ABOUT
I HOPE I HAVE NURSE
OUR SHEPHERD WAS ALMOST THIRTEEN YEARS OLD
I HOPE THEY ARE COMFORTABLE
A LOT OF PEOPLE GET CONVICTED
THAT MY CIVIL RIGHTS HAD BEEN VIOLATED
I LIKE COUNTRY AND WESTERN
I'M A QUALITY MANAGER
WE'RE SMARTER NOW
BRING MY COMPUTER HERE PLEASE
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO
I THINK I'M GETTING TOO OLD FOR ALL THAT
TRASH TALK IN SPORTS IS NOT RIGHT
THEN DON'T PAY IT
IT'S SUCH A JOY
YOU DO NOT CLEAN IT UP
I'M NOT REALLY KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THIS
THEY TOOK MY DENTAL INSURANCE AWAY
YOU ARE GOING
I HOPE YOU HEARD WHAT THEY SAID
SEVERAL MAGAZINES LIKE THAT A FEW YEARS AGO
I HEARD IT THAT TIME
MY HUSBAND WENT OVER TO THE HOUSE AND PAINTED THE WALLS
I HAVE DONE SOME BOW HUNTING
THIS LOCAL STORE WILL ALWAYS SELL GOOD QUALITY FOOD
I'LL BE HERE A LONG TIME AT THIS RATE
IT'S KIND OF FUN
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE NOW
BUY A TOILET PLUNGER
I'M GLAD YOU MENTIONED THAT
I REALLY THINK THAT MONEY'S HISTORY
I THINK THE WEATHER WILL BE WARM
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY MORE POWER
I GUESS HE'S TRAINED IN THIS
WE CERTAINLY NEED SOME CHANGE HERE
WILL YOU USE ANY OF THIS STUFF
I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT
HE'S GOT A COUPLE OF BOOKS OUT
PAY FOR PAPER TO RECYCLE
I'D SAY IT WAS ABOUT TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS
THE MOVIES ARE GOOD TOO
I HOPE THAT YOU LIKE THAT
SHE IS ON THE EAST COAST SOMEWHERE
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO STOP AND EXPLAIN
EVIDENTLY HE WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT
MY MEDICAL COVERAGE
EVERYONE KNOWS THEY'RE GOING TO GET IT
WE ALL HAVE A CHOICE
GOOD DECISION SO FAR
ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE IN A LOT OF TRAFFIC
LOOK AT EACH OTHER
NO ONE KNOWS WHAT THAT IS
PLEASE SEE MY FULL DISCLOSURE POLICY FOR DETAILS
THOUGH
I REALLY DIDN'T GET TO USE THEM
TRADITIONAL LOOKING
WELL THAT'S GOOD
SOME CLASSICAL MUSIC
YOU SHOULD SEE OUR WORK
THEY JUST ACCEPT IT
IT WAS ON THE NEWS THIS MORNING
SHE DID NOT SAY MUCH
I CAUGHT A FEW WHITE FISH YESTERDAY
WHICH IS MOST UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE WE ALL LOSE OUT
I THINK THEY END UP WORSE THAN THEY WERE BEFORE
THE YARD'S ALL FENCED IN SO SHE DOESN'T RUN LOOSE
THERE WAS NO REPORT OF ANY CASUALTY OR INJURY
SHE IS JUST A LITTLE GIRL
HOW THEY DO
THIS WILL APPEAL TO REGULAR SPORTS TEAM
HAS AFFECTED A LOT OF SOCIAL CHANGE
THE NATIVE TRIBES STILL OWN THE LAND
SHE CAME ACROSS AS A WONDERFUL AND KIND PERSON
THEY SEEMED SO PROUD OF EVERYTHING THEY DID
HE ONLY HAD THREE EMPLOYEES
NOT COMING UP
THEY DO NOT HAVE HOPE
SHE DID PRETTY WELL
I HOPE THAT YOU LIKE IT
I'M NOT A CARPENTER OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
THERE WAS THAT BIG PROBLEM
I WAS TIRED DURING THAT WHOLE MONTH
AND OF COURSE SOMETIMES THEY RENT MOVIES
THERE'S ANOTHER ASPECT OF THIS
ATTACHMENT AND RESPONSIBILITY
YOU GET SO ATTACHED TO THEM
THIS IS EXACTLY THE LAW
THIS PERSON NEEDS YOUR HELP NOW
OTHER THAN THAT THEY HAVE THE USUAL STUFF
AN ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEER
STOCKS IN EUROPE AND ASIA ALSO FELL
I HOPE I HAVE VERY GOOD FAMILY
USING A PAINT SPRAYER DOES RESULT IN A NICER FINISH
IF YOU DIDN'T MIND ME ASKING
PLEASE GO AWAY FROM HERE
WHAT KEEPS YOU DOING THAT
GOOD LUCK ON YOUR GRADUATION
WHAT IS YOUR NAME
HOPE YOU ENJOY THIS PIECE
THAT'S PROBABLY THE WORST
THE WAY THEY BEHAVE IS NOT ACCEPTABLE
I GUESS THEY CAN BE
IT IS VERY BAD
WHICH BRINGS UP AN IMPORTANT POINT
IT'S REALLY PRETTY GOOD
GET THINGS BACK THE WAY THEY WERE
SHE IS FULL OF HOPE THIS YEAR
FAMILY IS NOT GOOD
I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE AROUND ANYMORE
I GOT IT FOR MY BIRTHDAY
I HOPE IT IS YOU
LIKE THE OLD MOVIES FROM THE FIFTIES
IT WAS JUST LIKE ANY OTHER SYMPHONY
I MAY HAVE TO SEE THE VIDEO
BECAUSE I NEVER REALIZED IT
HE PROBABLY KNOWS THAT ALREADY
YOU DO NOT NEED GLASSES
THE NEWS IS A GOOD WAY TO KEEP UP TO DATE
THIS BAD FOR SO LONG
I DON'T HAVE ANY CHILDREN
IT WILL BE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE
THEY WILL TRASH THE CAMPING FIELD
CLOSURES AND JOB LOSSES
YOU'RE WITH THE HOME OFFICE NOW
I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT
I LISTEN TO A SONG
I SET UP MY COMPUTER MANUALLY
IT GIVES ME NO PLEASURE TO SEE ANYONE STRUGGLE
YOU'RE A MORMON THEN
I JUST REALIZED IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN
WHAT KIND OF CLOTHES SHOULD WE WEAR AT WORK
HOPE YOU HAVE ENJOYED THIS TUTORIAL
THE TELEVISION SERIES WAS CANCELLED RIGHT AFTER THAT
THIS IS ACTUALLY A VERY INTERESTING POINT
DRIVING ALL THE WAY TO JUST ORDER SOME FOOD IS BAD
I TRAVEL QUITE A BIT IN MY BUSINESS
HELP IS HERE
THERE REALLY WASN'T A BIG DIFFERENCE
I PAID FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR NEW CLOTHES
THEY HOPE MY FAMILY IS CLOSER
I TAKE CARE OF MY OWN YARD
I THINK IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER THAN THAT
HE LIVED A VERY PUBLIC LIFE
IT IS REALLY SCARY
YOU JUST FRY UNDER THE SUN
SHE CAN COVER QUITE AN AREA
GO LOOK UNDER THE BLEACHERS
MY NURSE IS RIGHT OUTSIDE
YOU DIDN'T WANT TO COOK LAST NIGHT
THERE'S A BIG VARIATION AMONG THE COUNTRY
WHAT IT COSTS NOW IS RIDICULOUS
THERE'S SO MUCH CRIMINAL ACTIVITY AROUND THERE
I CAN LISTEN TO THE RADIO IN MY OFFICE
I TALK TO MY HUSBAND
HOW DID YOU JOIN THE FIGHT
MY GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE
MAYBE WE'LL TALK AGAIN
IT'S TYPICAL FOR THIS PART OF THE JOURNEY
MY FAMILY IS GOING BACK HOME NEXT WEEK
I CAN GIVE YOU A CALL NEXT WEEK
HE CAN WALK AND HE'S SIX FOOT
BUT YOUR GROUP OF FRIENDS IS QUITE LARGE
KIND OF LIKE MY IDOL WHEN I WAS GROWING UP
IT WAS WEIRD BECAUSE WE HAD SNOW
IT'S REALLY NICE TO SEE THEM
AVOID THIS MUSIC WITH YOUR BABY
ABOUT TWENTY AFTER FOUR
FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME
THE LEAVES CHANGE COLOR IN THE FALL
WELL THAT'S ABOUT IT REALLY
DRIVING EARLY MORNING IN THE SNOW IS AWFUL
YOU DO IT
WE ARE HAVING A DECK PUT ON IN BACK
SHE'S KIND OF ALMOST STIFF AND YOU'RE NOT
THAT WAS A TRAGIC EXPERIENCE FOR US TOO
THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT I ALWAYS OWN
THIS EXPERIENCE RATHER HELPS
ARE YOU DONE WITH THIS
SO WHAT WAS THE POINT TO THIS EXERCISE
FIND SOMEONE AND PAY THEM TO DO IT
IT WAS A REALLY GOOD TIME
I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
I CAN NOT HANDLE IT FOR VERY LONG
I'M MAKING SOME FOOD FOR US
IT SEEMS TO BE NOT DIFFICULT ENOUGH FOR STUDENTS
I DO THAT WHEN WE TRAVEL
I AM GETTING TO THE POINT
IT IS VERY TIME CONSUMING
I AM GOING OUTSIDE
IT'S A PACKAGE DEAL
DOING BOTH TOGETHER IS DIFFERENT AND COULD BE MORE HARD WORK
I HEARD IT ONE TIME
WE HAD THE SAME TYPE OF SITUATION
AVOID CONTACT WITH EYES
YOU CAN ALWAYS BLAME IT ON HAVING CHILDREN
I GREW UP IN ALABAMA
IT'S GOING TO CONTINUE
I HAD TO GET IT TOWED AND THEN FIXED
AT LEAST THE PARENTS DID THEIR BEST
I KEEP A VISA CARD
THE COLLEGE DAYS ARE GONE
YOU LIKE IT YES
DO YOU
THEY HOPE I AM GOING
I HAVE NO NEED
EVERY CHILD NEEDS GOOD EDUCATION
ACTUALLY WE BOTH WORK THERE
THIS POLICY WILL HELP A LOT OF PEOPLE
I HOPE YOU ARE BAD
CAN YOU GET MY WATER
IT WAS MY FIRST TIME IN THE STATE OF OHIO
YOU SHOULD NOT GET INVOLVED
THEY'D SOON BE BACK
I USED TO HAVE A CHEVY
ABLE TO GIVE A FULL SAMPLE
IT IS NOT GOOD
DO YOU LIKE MUSIC
COUPLE OF DAYS TO GO
THEY ARE CERTAIN ABOUT THAT INVASION
I JUST LOVE TO TELL THIS STORY
THANKS FOR COMING HERE WITH ME
I DECIDED THAT THERE WAS NO POINT IN REPLYING
HE'S DOWN TO LIKE ONCE A WEEK
MY FAMILY IS RIGHT HERE
HOW MUCH TIME WILL YOU TAKE
ALL THE PROBLEMS
HOW TIRED IS MY NURSE
BUT HE WAS WITH ANOTHER COMPANY BEFORE THAT
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE THEM IN YOUR AREA
I GUESS I NEED TO PUT IT ON PAPER AND TURN IT IN
I HAVEN'T BEEN TO A BASEBALL GAME IN YEARS
WHO KNEW THIS WOULD HAPPEN
HOW BIG DO THEY GET
I KNOW I WANT A BIG FAMILY AREA
BETTER RUNNING AUTOMOBILES
I WOULD CONTEMPLATE GOING ON A CRUISE NOW
IT WAS KIND OF GETTING TO ME
THE BABY IS HAVING FUN WITH YOU
YOU HAVE NO COMPUTER
THEN I SAW THAT OTHER NATURE DOCUMENTARY ABOUT PENGUINS
WE HAVE BEEN TRYING FOR KIDS
THAT'S WHAT I HOPE
I HOPE YOU ARE HERE
I HAVE TO MAKE THIS ONE LAST AS LONG AS I CAN
THEY ARE MIGRANT HISPANIC FARM WORKERS
THAT WAS REALLY ON THE NATIONAL NEWS A LOT
IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE A TOWN HOME
IN THE GARAGE
DO I HAVE MUSIC
THERE WAS NO IMMEDIATE WORD ON ANY CASUALTIES
SOME OF THE STUDENTS
I DIDN'T HAVE A LOT
SHE WILL TELL HER FRIENDS
ACTUALLY IT MAKES SENSE TO A CERTAIN EXTENT
EXCUSE ME ONE SECOND
I LIKE TO VISIT THERE ONCE IN A WHILE
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU FOLLOW THIS SHOW
IN THE WINTER WE DO MORE CONCERT STUFF
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO WITH YOUR LIFE
WHAT WAS THE OTHER CASE
YOU ARE FROM THE DALLAS AREA IN TEXAS
THEY HAVE SOME NICE STUFF DOWN THERE
BUT I AM MORE PRODUCTIVE WHEN I'M IN PANTS
I WENT LOOKING FOR THAT PLACE TO EAT
I'M IN THE OIL BUSINESS
I WILL KNOW IT'S TRUE WHEN I HEAR IT
WE CAN PLAY WHATEVER MUSIC YOU ENJOY
HAVE YOU HEARD OF IT
ONE OF MY FRIENDS HERE
I LIKE HOW COMFORTABLE I AM
THE CARPET CLEANING COMPANIES
YOU ARE NOT OKAY
HE REALLY SAID THAT TO ME
I KNEW IT EVER SINCE YOU WERE A LITTLE BOY
DO YOU HATE YOUR MOTHER
MY NURSE IS COMING OUTSIDE
WHAT'S YOUR NAME
I'VE ONLY BEEN TO PHILADELPHIA TWICE
AFTER TALKING TO MY FAMILY I KNOW WHAT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO
I DON'T HAVE TO LIVE THROUGH MANY
WHO'S COMING IN THE EVENING
THERE'S SOME NICE STUFF OVER THERE TO SEE
I AM NOT VERY TIRED
I THINK I WOULD HAVE DONE A LOT BETTER
CHANGES TO EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE
WHAT WILL BE THE COST TO RUN THIS COMPANY
HER HOUSE IS SO FAR AWAY
THEN SHE RECOUPED
WE DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE A BUDGET
VERY GOOD MUSIC
EXACTLY HOW MANY CHOICES DO WE HAVE
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF YOU JOIN THEM
HE PROBABLY DOESN'T REMEMBER ME
I FILED MY TAXES EARLY THIS YEAR
WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO YOUR BUSINESS NOW
OILING THE ECONOMY
WATCHING THIS TOPIC GROW IS WONDERFUL
HAVE YOU LIVED IN DETROIT LATELY
SEATTLE IS ONLY ABOUT TWO AND A HALF HOURS FROM HERE
GLAD I NEVER HAD TO PAY FOR ONE
THIS PARTICULAR CARD
IT'S KIND OF NEAT
THIS MOVIE IS RARELY ON TELEVISION
DO YOU FEEL LIKE IT
READ MORE ABOUT THE DECISION HERE
I HOPE YOU HAVE SUCCESS
MORNING HOURS BRING LUCK TO THE BUSINESS
IF I FIND A GOOD BOOK
WOMEN LOVED THIS CAT THAT CAME ALONG
THIS IS SUCH A GREAT PLACE
WHAT IS OUTSIDE
DETROIT FREE PRESS
MY DAD IS A POTATO FARMER
MY BROTHER IN LAW WORKS THERE
YOU HAVE TO SUPPORT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE THERE
I JUST GOT MARRIED
I HOPE THEY ARE COMING
IT'S A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU
SAVES YOU A LITTLE BIT MONEY
ENJOY THE BAT
I AM CERTAINLY NOT A MORNING PERSON
WHERE I GO TO CHURCH NOW
HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN EACH OTHER
WE SHOULD USE EVERY LAST BIT OF IT
HAVING PARTICIPATED IN JURY DUTY MYSELF
THE PUPPIES ARE MISSING
LEAVE YOUR CHOICE IN THE COMMENTS
THERE'S NOT THAT MUCH OF A CHECK
THAT'S FANTASTIC EXERCISE
I LIKE MY FAITH
I HOPE MY NURSE IS HERE
MY FAMILY'S IMMIGRATION HISTORY IS COMPLICATED
AS LONG AS YOU WANT TO
I KNOW WHICH ONE COMES NEXT
SOCCER IS DESTROYING THE USA
THERE DEFINITELY IS
I'D LIKE TO SEE THEM GO TOO
THE FACT THAT THEY DID NOT RETALIATE
IT HAS BEEN REALLY BUSY
WHAT IS THE STATE OF YOUR OLD BOOK
WE HAD A LOVELY PICNIC IN THE WOODS TOGETHER
I HAVE MUCH MORE TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE TOPIC
HAVEN'T YOU WATCHED THAT MOVIE BEFORE
PEOPLE WILL DO WHATEVER THEY WANT TO DO
NOT VERY BAD
THAT MAKES ME FEEL A LITTLE BETTER OF COURSE
SO MANY THINGS TO DO BEFORE NEXT WEEK
IT MADE CLICKING NOISES IN BACKGROUND
HOW THEY'RE GOING TO FEEL ABOUT IT
I HAVE TO WAIT FOR THINGS TO GO ON SALE
THE MENTAL CAPACITY TO RAISE THEM
YOU DO NOT LIKE MY COMPUTER
TELL MY FAMILY THEY DO NOT FEEL HUNGRY
THEY WOULD EAT YOU
I HAVE ONE DAUGHTER THAT WORKS FULL TIME
TOY PLANES HAVE TO HAVE WINGS
ANYTHING SPIRITUAL
SHE'LL BE TWO YEARS OLD IN JULY
WAS THIS HIS ENTIRE FAMILY
I PERSONALLY FEEL IT
I HOPE IT IS CLOSER
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF PRESSURE
I CERTAINLY AM TOO
WE HAVE A FULL PROGRAM THIS YEAR
THIS IS MY IDEA TO MAKE IT WORK WELL
MY POINT OF VIEW
WHICH I THOUGHT WAS INTERESTING
THAT IS ONE OF MY SOLUTIONS
IT'S JUST THE OLD GUYS THAT ARE STILL THERE
I CAN HEAR THE NOISE
YOUR STANDARDS CHANGE
TELL US WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN NOW
THAT'S NOT MY PROBLEM
WHAT DO YOU CLEAN
HE'S OUT FOR GOOD
HUNDRED THINGS TO DO NOW
THE LAST PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
BUILD AND DEPLOY MANUALLY
SOMEWHERE THEY CAN SIT DOWN AND WRITE DOWN WHAT
THAT WOULD BE REALLY AWFUL
HER MOTHER WAS VERY OLD
THEY HAD PEOPLE WHO TOOK CARE OF THE YARD
IT'S AN IMPORTANT DECISION FOR MY CAREER
HE IS STILL HERE
I'M SURE I DIDN'T
THEY DID NOT TELL ME ANYTHING ABOUT THIS
WELL THAT'S WHY I ENDED UP GIVING IT BACK TO HIM
HE WANTED TO IMPROVE THE HIGHWAYS
DOES THE COMPANY YOU WORKED FOR GIVE BONUSES
OUT INTO THE WORLD
HE NEEDS TO GO OUTSIDE MORE OFTEN
JUST SO YOU'LL KNOW
NOW I DON'T WANT A CAN
I THINK THERE'S STILL A CHOICE TO BE MADE
TELL MY FAMILY GOODBYE
I HOPE MY FAMILY IS GOOD
THEY WILL GIVE THIS BOOK AWAY FOR FREE
THIS COUPLE WILL SHOW UP SOON
I DO NOT NEED HELP
I KNOW IT'S OLDER THAN THE REGENCY
CLAY PIGEONS THINGS LIKE THAT
CAR PAYMENT SUCKS A HELL OF A LOT OF IT DRY
MEASUREMENTS OF ABOUT HALF A MILLION DISTANT GALAXIES
THAT'S MAYBE NOT SO TYPICAL
BROWN AND BLACK PATCHES OF FUR
MURDERED AND SO I REALLY WOULDN'T KNOW
ABOUT THE FOURTH DAY
THE BRAND NEW ANDROID TELEVISION BOX
MY CARS DON'T GO TO THE SHOP
I WAS TRYING TO HAVE SOME FUN
I WAS PRETTY MUCH GIVING UP MY LIFE
IF IT'S NOT AUTOMATIC
PLEASE DO NOT BRING GIFTS TO MY BIRTHDAY PARTY
BOTH OF THEIR CATS ARE DECLAWED
YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THAT
THAT'S DEFINITELY TRUE
IT'S NEVER STICKY OR GRAINY FEELING
TELL MY FAMILY THEY ARE NOT COMFORTABLE
IT'S REALLY UNFORTUNATE
THE PRINCIPAL SENT HIM RIGHT BACK TO CLASS
HER VOICE QUAVERED
THE WEATHER IS NICE EXCEPT FOR WHEN IT RAINS
WE LET HER GO WHERE SHE WANTED TO
YOU SHOULD NOT TAKE WHAT IS NOT YOURS
THE WIND AND SUN AND EVERYTHING WAS INCREDIBLE
AM I STILL EMPLOYED
THAT WAS OUTSIDE
YES IT IS RIGHT
FOR ME IT'S ACTUALLY A PRETTY GOOD TOPIC
I WAS JUST ABSOLUTELY SHOCKED
HAVE THEIR BELLIES RUBBED AND EVERYTHING
YOU'RE A RED SOX FAN TOO
I HAVE FUN DOING IT
DO YOU MIND GOING TO THE CLASS TODAY
VITAMINS AND NUTRIENTS ARE ESSENTIAL FOR GOOD VISION
DO YOU BELIEVE IN THIS PART
THAT'S WHERE I NEED TO GO
HAVING A JOB WILL KEEP YOU OUT OF TROUBLE
PLEASE CLEAN IT UP
MAYBE WE WILL GET YOUR GUY
WOULDN'T IT BE WONDERFUL IF WE GO TOGETHER
LEARN HOW TO MEASURE AND SCORE IT HERE
THOSE ARE ALL GREAT
I GUESS I NEVER HEARD THE HISTORY OF THAT
AND THEN SUNDAY NIGHTS WE WATCH
HE HAS BEEN IN PRISON THREE OR FOUR TIMES
HE COULD GET HURT
IF YOU WANT TO PLAY TENNIS
IT IS NEVER TOO LATE FOR EDUCATION
YOU ALL HAVE MUCH TROUBLE UP THERE
ALLOW THE SOUP TO BOIL ON LOW FLAME FOR TWENTY MINUTES
GARLIC IS THE ONLY THING YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO PUT IN THERE
I FEEL SO SILLY
WE WILL WORRY ABOUT WHO HE IS LATER
I'LL DO IT FOR A HUNDRED DOLLARS
I HAVE MY CARD SOMEWHERE
MY COMPUTER IS NOT OKAY
I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN IN LINE THE WHOLE TIME
THIS IS A SPECIAL QUALITY PIECE
I'M NOT SURE WHAT HAPPENED
TELL MY FAMILY I AM COMFORTABLE
WE DID MORE AND MORE OF THAT
I USUALLY LOVE TO EAT THERE
TELL MY FAMILY I AM THIRSTY
THE TELEVISION RATINGS DON'T COME OUT UNTIL NEXT WEEK
I WISH THEY WOULD REQUIRE IT
I LIKED IT BECAUSE I WANT TO GO
ALL OF US NEED TO EAT
GOODBYE
ENJOY THE POWER AND BEAUTY OF YOUR YOUTH
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR PERCENT IS ON YOUR PHONE
DO THEY GIVE ANY LIMITS ON ALCOHOL
THIS TOPIC DOES NOT GET TALKED ABOUT OFTEN
THERE IS A POND
AND THEN SHE SEWED THE BUTTONS ONTO THE SHIRT
WE OFTEN LIKE TO EAT LOCAL FOOD
THE RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS
FIFTEEN MINUTES BEFORE
THINGS ARE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THERE
I THINK HE'S THE ONLY ONE WHO KNOWS HOW IT WORKS
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE SOLUTION IS
I AM GOOD HOW ARE YOU
HE DIED IN A HOLY CAUSE
I DO NOT CHARGE EXCEPT FOR EMERGENCIES
I'VE NEVER BEEN UP THERE
THAT'S THE KEY THERE
ANYWHERE FROM TWO TO FOUR SEMESTERS
I DON'T MEAN TO BE RUDE
THAT'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET OUT THE SITUATION
I ALSO MADE A LITTLE THING FOR A BABY GIFT
IT'S SO FUNNY
LET'S TAKE THIS AS AN EXAMPLE
PLEASE DO IT
GOOD SOCIAL INTERACTION
THAT IS VERY INTERESTING
I WENT THERE A COUPLE OF TIMES WITH MY MOTHER IN LAW
YOU GOT ANY MORE
WE WOULD BE WILLING TO MAKE THAT SACRIFICE
THE AIR CONDITIONING PROBLEM
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE SOMETHING
I SAY WE SHOULD DO THIS
DO YOU EAT WHAT YOU FISH
IN HIS LEAGUE DO THEY HAVE A PITCHER
THIS IS THE BEST AREA IN MY HOUSE
THERE IS NO REAL COUNTER MEASUREMENT
I WONDER HOW MUCH THAT KIND OF STUFF COSTS
BE IT THROUGH DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS
THEY HAVE ALL GOT REALLY GOOD JOBS
I THINK TECHNOLOGY IS BETTER
AFTER THAT'S COOKED
MY FAMILY IS NOT HUNGRY
MAYBE WHAT THEY SAID IS REALLY TRUE
DO YOU ENJOY WRITING AND SHARING YOUR KNOWLEDGE
MY MUSIC IS HERE
IT COST HER THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS
THEY ARE NOT HUNGRY
AM I GOING
IT WAS AN OLDER HOME
I HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE
ONE PERSON CANNOT CHANGE THE WHOLE WORLD
IS MY NURSE VERY HUNGRY
I JUST HAPPEN TO BE OFF TODAY
DO NOT EVEN BOTHER
WHETHER HE IS OR NOT
BOTH FLOWERS AND VEGETABLE GARDENING
THEY NEED SUCCESS
I THINK HE KIND OF MISSES IT A LITTLE BIT
SIGN PAPERS THAT SAY THIS IS YOURS
THE SUN HAS FINALLY STARTED SETTING LATER IN THE DAY
IT'S JUST BASICALLY DRIVING A LONG WAYS TO WORK
TO FIND THE RIGHT ONE
AT THE END OF THE DAY RESPECT IS A CHOICE
I FIND I HAVE TO GET THE RIGHT KIND OF THING
IT'S A FANTASTIC MOVIE
ENJOY YOUR DAY
I THINK THAT THAT'S PROBABLY TRUE
ARE YOU BOTH FROM UTAH ORIGINALLY
AND THEN YOU JUST COOK THEM OVER A GRILL
I HAVE HIGH HOPE FOR YOU
WATCH IT IN HIGH RESOLUTION AND ENJOY
THE SECOND THING IS
WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT
IT WAS A DECISION THAT WOULD PAY OFF
THE POLICE SENT IN THE BOMB SQUAD
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG HERE
I THINK PEOPLE ARE RIGHT ABOUT THIS
WHAT BRINGS YOU GUYS HERE
SHE HAS EVERYTHING PLANNED SO CLOSELY
TESTING DEPENDS ON SOUND QUALITY
BOTH MEASURES PASSED LARGELY ALONG PARTY LINES
I LIVE NEAR A WALMART
I'VE HAD SO MANY PEOPLE
HE'S SOMEONE DIFFERENT
I REALLY MISS THEM A LOT
THAT'S REALLY A TERRIFIC FEELING
NONE OF THEM ARE TOO INTERESTED IN CURRENT EVENTS
I CALLED THE MINUTE THE SUN WENT DOWN
I JUST DON'T WANT TO DO IT
AND THEY BOTH ENJOY IT
KNOCKED THE SOCKS OFF OF THEM
DO YOU WHAT
THIS IS A PUBLIC PLACE
I CONSIDER AN INVASION OF MY PRIVACY
IT IS A PLEASURE TO BE WITH KIDS
THE BABY IS GROWING UP
I AM GOOD FOR NOW
I WATCH THAT A COUPLE OF TIMES A WEEK
YES I THINK I CAN
IT'S A LOW KEY PLACE AS FAR AS THE DRESS CODE GOES
THEY DON'T HAVE OIL OR ANYTHING
DO YOU THINK MY JOKES ARE FUNNY
BUT THEY'RE NOT MAKING NEW ONES
A GOOD POSITIVE DIRECTION
ORANGES FOR THE ROYAL FAMILY
I'M SURE NO ONE WILL BE ANNOYED BY THIS
I DO THE NEWSPAPER AND CARDBOARD AND PAPER
I HOPE THEY ARE GOING
THE LONGER AND LONGER IT GOES
I JUST LIKE TO SIT DOWN AND WATCH IT
IT SEEMS VERY SAD TO ME
IT'S NOT TOO MUCH TROUBLE
WELL I'M JUST THANKING HEAVEN
SEVENTY NINE DEGREES
WILL YOU COME HOME LATE TODAY
I NEED MY NURSE RIGHT HERE
HELP GUIDE SOME CRAFT PROGRAMS
THAT IS VERY COMFORTABLE
I NEED SOME MORE TIME FOR MY WORK
YOU STILL NEED YOUR MOTHER'S PERMISSION
HAVE YOU HAD ANY ADVENTURES ON YOUR CAMPING TRIPS
THE STATUS QUO FOR PUERTO RICO
I'M ON THE PHONE
WHATEVER YOU WOULD CALL IT
YES YOU ARE COMING HERE
WE SHOULD ALL HELP EACH OTHER
I LIKE A GOOD JOKE
UNITED STATES TROOPS COULD STILL GET INVOLVED
YOU BUY THESE SUPER GIANT HEAVY DUTY PAPER BAGS
THIS ONE THAT YOU RAISED
DO YOU BOTH STUDY GEOLOGY
I DON'T HAVE CHILDREN YET
IN EACH OF THE DORMS THEY HAVE A PLACE FOR THAT
THAT WOULD BE GREAT
WHAT LED TO THE DECISION TO START A RECORD LABEL
WHAT YOU ARE
THOSE ARE THE ONES I REALLY ENJOY
I WORK FOR A GOVERNMENT CONTRACTOR
YOU'RE ALERT FOR THE KID WHO'S VERY DROWSY
YOU HAVE TO HAVE THAT NEEDLE
WE USED TO DO THAT
MILITARY SERVICE IS NOT THAT MUCH
IT ALL DEPENDS ON HOW THIS SOUNDS
YOU LIVE IN PENNSYLVANIA
I DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE THE PRESIDENT
THEY TELL YOU MY NURSE IS COMFORTABLE
SO IT SEEMS TO BE
I HOPE YOU HAVE GOOD LUCK WITH THIS
I WILL PROBABLY CHANGE MY FULL TIME JOB AT THE END
WHAT HAVE THEY DONE NOW
I HAVE KNOWN THIS FRIEND FOR TWENTY YEARS
WHAT PART OF THE STATE DO YOU LIVE IN
I HAVE NEVER BEEN TO UTAH
I LIVED IN INDIANA FOR A WHILE
HOW LONG WILL YOU BE AWAY
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER VOICE
IT WAS A HUGE MESS
I DID NOT ENJOY WORKING IN FLORIDA
YOU ACTUALLY GO IN THERE
HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE
HE REALLY LIKES IT AND I DON'T
THAT BOY WAS GOING OVER THERE
YET THE DELUSION PERSISTS
YOU ARE JUST LIKE A PIG
VOID EATER
WE HAVE SOME MORE THAT NEED TO BE DONE
I TEND TO AGREE WITH YOU
I JUST KEEP THEM
THE COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS
SHE HAD THAT DONE A WHILE AGO
I LOVE CHEESE CAKE
IF I WERE TO BUY ANOTHER CAR
THAT'S PRETTY BAD
THAT WAS WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY
THAT AREA IS REALLY EXPANDING
AM I COMING UP
HOW DO YOU VIEW THIS WHOLE SUBJECT
I HAVE THREE LEFT LIVING AT HOME
LIFE IS SO MUCH MORE ENJOYABLE
HOW OLD ARE YOU
THE BOY'S FATHER SUFFERED SIMILARLY
THAT'S WHAT YOU FIND
I HAVE SEEN THAT HE GOES THERE EVERY DAY
MAYBE THEY'RE STARTING TO GET A CLUE
THEY SEE THAT WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME TOGETHER
I'VE GOT SOME EXCITING NEWS TO SHARE ABOUT PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT
A MEXICAN DINNER
HE HAS A TERRIBLE WEIGHT PROBLEM
WE MOVED TO LIVE NEAR THE COAST
GROWING YOUR BENEFITS IS IMPORTANT
IT'S A REALLY OLD BUSH
YOU SHOULD SEE OUR HOUSE
WHEN MY FATHER WORKED THERE
ANESTHESIA FOR HIP OR KNEE REPLACEMENT SURGERY
THE CHOICE IS UP TO EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US
WE HAVE A FRIEND THAT LIVES TWO BLOCKS OVER
WHATEVER YOU THINK IS RIGHT
EVERYTHING ISN'T ALWAYS SOMEBODY ELSE'S FAULT
THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE COLLEGE SYSTEM
HOW DID YOU MAKE A QUILT
I DO NOT READ EVERYTHING IN THE PAPER
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
THERE'S QUITE A WAITING LIST TO GET INTO THAT
I DO NOT LIKE GLASSES
THEY WERE OUTSIDE MY GARAGE
PRESIDENTS HAVE ALWAYS AVOIDED THAT AS A COUNTRY
I THINK YOUR FRIEND IS SOMEWHERE IN THERE
BRING A LARGE POT OF WATER TO BOIL ON THE STOVE
TELL MY NURSE HELLO
I MEAN ABOUT FIFTEEN TO TWENTY PERCENT
THIS COLLEGE PROGRAM LOOKED WONDERFUL
START BY CONCENTRATING AND INCREASING YOUR VISUALIZATION POWER
I AM NOT TALKING TO YOU
BIG CLOSET SPACE
I AM NERVOUS ABOUT VISITING DALLAS
DRAW YOUR OWN CONCLUSIONS
MOST OF US TEND TO AVOID PAIN HOWEVER WE CAN
LOT OF MONEY SPENT ON THIS
I DON'T HAVE TOO MANY WEAKNESSES
WHAT IS THIS COMPANY WORTH
I WANT TO GO THERE WITH MY FAMILY
WHAT CHANGED YOUR MIND
I WANTED SOMEONE TO MAKE MY DECISION FOR ME
THIS FOOD SOMETIMES IS NOT ENOUGH
I NEED SUCCESS RIGHT HERE
SOMEONE SAID THAT WAS A LOT OF FUN TO GO DO
THAT WILL BE FUN IF YOU HAVE
I'VE GOT THREE CARD OFFERS NOW
A PERPETUAL PROBLEM
WHAT IS BIG TODAY
I HOPE THEY ARE HUNGRY
I DID THE DANCE STEP
MOTHER WAS DRIVING FOR THOUSAND MILES
IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE IT'S NOT
I HAVE TRAVELED AROUND THE WORLD A FEW TIMES
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO FALL INTO THAT
I HOPE THE REST OF YOU ENJOY YOUR NIGHT
SHE KNEW THIS CITY VERY WELL
MINE TAUGHT KINDERGARTEN
THIS TIME I HAD NO CHOICE IN THE MATTER
I WILL MOSTLY GO FOR A RUN AT NIGHT
I MEAN HE'S DOING ALL RIGHT
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT
THEY CAN'T SURVIVE OUT THERE
I THINK THIS PAPER IS REALLY VERY FUNNY
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S NEXT
YOU FEEL VERY BAD
IT JUST DEPENDS ON WHERE YOU GO
HOPE YOU ARE RIGHT
PUNISHMENT SHOULD FIT THE CRIME
YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH
YOU CAN GET THAT TOO
NOTHING GOES PAST MY MOTHER
HOW DO YOU HAVE IT
IT'S REALLY A RELEASE
THIS WAS A LONG TIME AGO
I KNEW THE MINUTE I SAW THE PAPER
TELL MY NURSE YOU ARE NOT THIRSTY
HOW MANY PEOPLE IN YOUR BAND
THIS SESSION IS ABOUT TO RUN OUT
THEY JUST WORK HARDER
WHEN I CHANGED THOSE OVER
WE BOUGHT IT IN AROUND NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE
I REMEMBER IT LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY
I LIKE HIS MOVIES
THIS WILL MAKE OR BREAK YOU
I THINK THAT WOULD BE A WONDERFUL WAY TO DO IT
WHERE IS THAT HELP
AND THAT KIND OF THING
WE WERE SUPPOSED TO GO THERE FIRST
I HAVE SEEN IT
IN LEGISLATION OR IN WORK
NOW I HAVE TWO LITTLE KIDS
THAT DINNER WAS VERY GOOD
WHAT WAS THE TOPIC OF DISCUSSION
I REALLY LIKE IT AND YET I AM NOT SURE I WANT IT
I HEAR YOU HAVE KIDS
WE HAVE INCREDIBLY LOW PROPERTY TAXES DOWN HERE
THIS MORNING OUR PAPER WAS WET
WARPED REAL EASY
SO DO YOU GO TO COLLEGE RIGHT NOW
HOW HAVE YOU CHANGED YOUR OPINION
SHE GOT ABOUT TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS
WHERE ARE YOU OFF TO
ARE MY GLASSES BAD
THEY REALLY ARE VERY GOOD
THREE HOUR DIFFERENCE
I'M SURE IT DOES
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT FEELS LIKE THERE IS NO POINT
OCCASIONALLY I'LL SEE THAT ONE
YOU MOVED HERE FROM CALIFORNIA
I HOPE YOU ENJOYED IT
NEED IT HERE
I DIDN'T WATCH THEM
WHETHER IT'S A MURDER CASE
THOSE PEOPLE SIMPLY DID NOT HAVE ACCESS TO SAFETY
HER SISTER DIED LAST YEAR
WHO REALLY GETS TO PICK THEIR COLLEGE
THEY REBUILT THAT SCHOOL A YEAR AGO
THEY BUY A PLACE AND THEY JUST HATE THE AREA
I JUST SIGNED UP FOR IT
THIS IS BIG EVEN FOR ME
EXCEPT LIKE I SAID
THEY WERE TOLD THAT
I'M NOT OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER THAT ONE
I AM THAT GOOD
NOT JUST FOR DEALING IN DRUGS
PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE BETTER
THERE'S A LITTLE SENSING DEVICE INSIDE THE PHONE
SEVEN YEARS IN THE PROS
I WENT TO AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT BANK
WHAT DO YOU FEEL LIKE
SHE WAS MY FAVORITE CHARACTER ON THERE
WHAT'S IN STORE FOR US THIS YEAR
BECAUSE I'VE HEARD ABOUT THE MANY ABUSES OF THE LAW
PLEASE THINK THIS THROUGH
I DON'T KNOW QUITE HOW TO DO IT
IT'S ACTUALLY THE FIRST CAR WE EVER BOUGHT NEW
I'D LIKE TO GO CAMPING CROSS COUNTRY
THEY WILL DO THE CREDIT CHECK FOR FREE
WE SHOULD GO THERE NEXT WEEK
HOW THIRSTY IS MY FAMILY
WHENEVER THEY GAVE THEM OUT
AND THERE'S NO CONSISTENCY
LET'S GO VISIT FOR LIKE A SHORT WEEKEND OR SOMETHING
MOTIVATE OURSELVES
AFRICA OR THE LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES
YOUR INVESTMENTS ARE ALSO AFFECTED BY THE TAX REGIME
I'VE GOT A TWO YEAR OLD DAUGHTER AND A FOUR YEAR OLD SON
THE STORM IS MOVING NORTH
THERE WAS ONLY LIKE TWO OR THREE
IT IS BAD
THAT WAS KIND OF FUN
HOW IS YOUR LIFE IN THE NEW CITY
SO THE DISEASE IS NOT REALLY CURED
PUT ON MY MASK
NEVER GONNA TELL A LIE AND HURT YOU
WHERE YOU ARE
THIS WAS PASTURE LAND
THAT CAN SHOW UP AS A POSITIVE TEST
IT HAD A FACE THAT LOOKED LIKE A MOUSE
USUALLY I LIKE TO TALK TO THEM FIRST
THE LAW BOOK IS CLEAR ON THIS
KEEP THIS STUFF WITH YOU FOR NOW
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MOVIES IN GENERAL
IT WASN'T AS BAD AS THIS LAST YEAR
STAY AT HOME AND DO EVERYTHING
USUALLY WE GET ABOUT ONE OR TWO CALLS A DAY
WE HAVEN'T HAD A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH THE NEW COMPUTER AT ALL
I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW EASY THIS IS
WHATEVER MANNER THEY WANT TO
YOU CAN THANK ME LATER
IT'S JUST GOING TO FOLLOW
THAT THEY HAD TO PUT IN AND BASICALLY IT WAS A CHOICE
THAT'S BECAUSE I'M ALLERGIC TO THE GRASS
ANYTHING WILL DO AT THIS TIME I GUESS
THAT'S ONE WAY
FAMILIES LIKE TO VISIT THIS PLACE TOGETHER
AND ON THAT POINT I HAVE TO AGREE WITH THEM
I'VE KNOWN PEOPLE THAT HAVE USED A PACKAGE
I DON'T DRIVE ONE A LOT
I HAD HAD EVERYONE IN MY DEPARTMENT RECYCLING
I'LL PROBABLY HAVE TO SELL THE PRIZE I GET
I WOULD PREFER TO HAVE IN HOME CARE
HOTTER THAN USUAL
AMBIANCE DOWN THERE
SOMETIMES IT'S REWARDING
FIVE OF US ARE COMING TONIGHT
THEY WON'T TAKE THOSE
THIS IS THE KIND OF THING YOU LOOK AT
I EARNED FIFTY CENTS A DAY
I HAD AN OCCASION TO CHANGE
THAT'S A HARD ISSUE
I WISH IF THEY WERE GOING TO DO IT
I HAVE EVERYTHING I NEED RIGHT HERE
THE QUALITY OF THEIR PRODUCT
I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY
THIS IS MY FIRST DAY OF COLLEGE
THIS ROOM SEEMS TO BE REALLY COLD
IT'S A LOT CHEAPER THERE
I'M IN ONE COMMUNITY BAND HERE
I'M PUSHING OUR COMPANY TOWARDS THAT
EXACT AMOUNT THAT WE SPEND ON THAT EACH YEAR
ONE OF THOSE LOANS
MAJOR INTEREST ON SOCIAL CREDIT
WHEN YOU'RE FIRST MARRIED OR STARTING OUT
SHE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW HOW
I'M TRYING TO LEARN HOW TO COOK
PATIENTS ARE GIVEN ANESTHESIA FOR HIP OR KNEE REPLACEMENT SURGERY
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU CALLED BY THE WAY
I HOPE IT IS OKAY
MANNING SAID THAT DECISION MEANT A LOT TO HIM
AND THAT IS ALL OF IT
WHAT IS THE FIRST THING YOU CAN SEE
IT WAS A BIG CHANGE
I THINK IT'S A REALLY GOOD IDEA
CAN YOU PLAY WITH MY DOG FOR A BIT
I CAN HEAR IT IN YOUR VOICE
SHE WILL BUY A LOT OF THEM
HE WILL KEEP COMING BACK TO EAT
IT MAKES MY LIFE AND MY WORK A LOT EASIER
GENERATIONS FROM NOW
EITHER THIS WEEK OR THE NEXT ONE
REALISTICALLY IT IS NOT A GOOD IDEA
THIS CAN HAPPEN TO THE BEST OF US
I ALWAYS GET THOSE SPAM PHONE CALLS
HER HUSBAND TOLD HER THAT
I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE EXPEDITED
THEY HAVE HOPE
EVENING TIME IT GETS PRETTY BUSY
THERE WAS A REAL BIG COCAINE BUST LAST NIGHT
THERE'S JUST SO MUCH MASS THERE
HAVE YOU HEARD OF THE DEPENDENCY INVERSION PRINCIPLE
THE LAST TIME WE SWAM IN THE PACIFIC OCEAN
THEY RENAMED THEIR JOBS
NEVER GONNA GIVE YOU UP
THAT'S ALL THEY GOT RIGHT NOW
WHAT DO THEY TELL YOU
A FEW LITTLE GRAMMATICAL PROBLEMS
WHAT IS GOOD
PLEASE NOT LIKE THAT
THEY ARE NOT THIRSTY
IS THE HOTEL ALL BOOKED UP
ALL I KNEW WAS YOU GO TO HIGH SCHOOL
TELL MY NURSE YOU ARE NOT COMFORTABLE
THE GAME STARTS NOW
IT LOOKED ARCHAIC
NO I AM NOT COMFORTABLE
HELLO HOW ARE YOU
WHAT DID YOU SAY YOUR NAME WAS
RHINO POACHING IN ASIA IS ALSO ON THE RISE
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IT
WE HAVE DAY CARE
MOST OF ASIA SHOWS THE OPPOSITE TREND
I HAVE ALWAYS KIND OF ENJOYED IT
MY NURSE IS LIKE THAT
EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE SO CLOSE
IT WOULD MAKE LIFE EASIER
SHE TOOK THE FIRST CAR SHE FOUND
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN GET TO CANADA FROM HERE
YOU CLEAN IT UP
HOPE YOU HAVE IT
THEY'RE REAL ACTIVE IN VOLUNTEER WORK
WE'RE GOING TO BUY A DEVON REX
JUST OUR OWN DESIGN
PUT A BIG CAST ON IT
WHAT CHOICE DO WE HAVE
OCCASIONALLY THESE THINGS MAY NOT BE TRUE
ARE YOU VERY THIRSTY
HE HAS USED A LOT
AND ON THE OTHER SIDE I SEE MYSELF AGAIN
I CAN SELL ALL MY CLOTHES
WE ALWAYS HAD HORSES
HOW TIRED IS MY FAMILY
PART OF MY JOB IS TEACHING
I CAN'T WAIT FOR THEM TO GET IT STARTED
AND HE DECIDED TO CHOOSE JOY
R E F I L L
BROADCAST DIVISION OF THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
SURE THAT IT'S WORTH IT
SHE IS REALLY INTERESTED IN THINGS LIKE THAT
TAKE A STASH OF BOOKS OR SMALL QUIET TOYS
YOU DON'T GET NEARLY ENOUGH EXERCISE
PLEASE DO
THEY LOOK LIKE THEY'RE VERY STURDY
I'VE QUIT DOING THAT MYSELF
YOU REALLY DID QUITE WELL
I'M SURPRISED THAT MORE STATES DON'T DO THAT
I GUESS THERE ARE A FEW THINGS AROUND STILL
MY MOTHER THOUGHT THIS WILL BRING MORE TROUBLE
I FEEL THAT THIS IS REALLY CLOSE
GOODBYE WHAT
MORALLY I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA
I SOLD SOME OF THEM
ONLY EGOS FEARS AND ILLUSION SEPARATE US
COMING HERE
FREE WILL IS AN ILLUSION
THIS IS THE REAL SOCIAL CREDIT FOR US
HOW BIG IS THE FAMILY YOU COOK FOR
YOU ENJOY EVERY STEP YOU TAKE
WHAT IS THIS AWFUL NOISE
THAT GUY MADE MANY GOOD CHOICES
HERE IS WHAT IT ALL BOILS DOWN TO
I'M NOT THE ONE WHO WRITES THE ORDERS
MY VISION IS PRETTY GOOD
WHAT DID YOU FIND IN THE COUNTRY
TALK TO YOU ON THE NEXT GO AROUND
MY FAMILY IS NOT LIKE THAT
IT IS ALWAYS BETTER TO GO THERE EARLY
MAYBE HE WON'T REMEMBER THIS
DESTROYING THINGS IS MUCH EASIER THAN MAKING THEM
YOU GET BACK INTO A POLITICAL THING
WE DON'T USUALLY TAKE THE KIDS WHEN WE GO THERE
YOU ARE TIRED
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO EAT
EAGLES FANS WERE NOT HAPPY WITH THIS DECISION
YOU ARE NOT GOING
THERE WERE NO CASUALTIES
FIND OUT WHERE THE LANGUAGES ARE
THAT'S ONLY FAIR
YES THIS IS TRUE
HER BODY WAS FOUND BY HER BOYFRIEND
I'M IN UPSTATE NEW YORK
WHO LIVES IN THIS HOUSE
IT IS GREEN SOMETIMES
THE OTHER CHILDREN IN THE CENTER HATED READING TIME
HOW AM I GOING OUTSIDE
YES MY NURSE IS GOING HERE
PLEASE LET'S CHANGE THE TOPIC
THEY'RE MAKING MONEY OFF THAT
MY PARENTS WILL SELL THEIR OLD HOUSE
THE ADVOCATE FOR THE HOMELESS
HELLO HERE I AM OUTSIDE
REMEMBER TO TAKE YOUR STUFF WITH YOU
A BIG CHUNK OF IT IS WORD PROCESSING
IT'S LIKE A BULLET GOING BY
AT A MILLION DOLLARS
I WANT TO GO OUT
WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO
AND IT SOUNDS REALLY NEAT
WHAT AMOUNT WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE
ANYWHERE ON THE EAST COAST
THAT'S WHAT THEY DO
NOW HE'S WORKING IN RHODE ISLAND
YOU HAVE TO BE SO PRECISE
THEY HAVE ONE OF THE CLERKS UP THERE
CRITIC'S CHOICE AWARD
THEY TAKE SUCH A BEATING
WELL I KNOW ABOUT IT
SHE ASKED THEM THERE IF THERE WAS SOME
THEY BLOOMED IN THE SPRING
THEY COULD BE JUST ABOUT EQUAL
REPLACE SOME OF THE BELTS IN THE MACHINE
WHAT SHOULD I DO
I'VE USED A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF SHAREWARE
FRUSTRATING AT TIMES
SOMETIMES DRUGS ARE FOUND TUCKED AWAY IN TOILET STALLS
IT IS NOT BAD
A LITTLE NATIVITY SCENE
HOW DO YOU TELL THAT
HE JUST TURNED FORTY
WHAT DO YOU CALL THOSE THINGS
THIRTY AMERICAN PEOPLE MADE THIS POLICY FOR EVERYONE
I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT IT'S QUITE LOW
USUALLY FALL INTO ONE OR TWO CATEGORIES
LOOKING AT THE DEGREE AT THE END
IS MY FAMILY COMING
I LIKE TO HAVE SOMEBODY COME WITH ME
THANK YOU FOR TALKING TO ME
I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN WORK SOMETHING OUT HERE
THEY HAVE NO SUCCESS
BECAUSE THEY FIGHT THE BEST
WE AT LEAST AGREE ON WHAT WE ENJOY
I USED TO JOG
DOING THE SENTENCING
WE HAVE ESTABLISHED THE DEFENDANT'S INNOCENCE
I UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION
UNFORTUNATELY WE TEND TO MAKE THESE EQUATIONS
IT'S PRETTY FUNNY
ENJOY THE REST OF YOUR DAY
I'VE NEVER LIKED CREDIT CARDS
EVER SEEN ONE OF THESE BAD BOYS
AND I HAVE A LOT OF CHOICES RIGHT NOW
I HAVE HAD SHRIMP
IT'S CLOSE TO PHILADELPHIA AND BALTIMORE
WE WILL MISS EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE
YOU CAN LEAVE THE KIDS WITH ME WHEN YOU GO OUT
I USED DRUGS LAST WEEK
THAT IS A PROBLEM
I HAVEN'T DONE THAT
LET ME RUN IN HERE
I USED TO LIKE THIS SHOW LAST YEAR
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT WOMEN IN THE TECHNOLOGY SECTOR
HOW DO YOU LIKE MUSIC
I'D LIKE TO GO BIRD WATCHING
THEY WANT ME TO BE A GOOD BOY
ARE YOUR FRIENDS INTERESTED IN THE GAME
WELL THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE
NICE HOUSE AND ALL THAT
THIS BABY LOVES YOUR MUSIC
IT IS VERY LITTLE
THE CONTEST ITSELF IS EXCITING
YOU'RE VERY CONSERVATIVE
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK I CAN DO THIS
BASICALLY THE CITY HAS A DRUG PROBLEM
MY MUSIC IS VERY GOOD
I WANT A GERMAN SHEPHERD
SAN ANTONIO ISN'T THAT CLOSE TO YOU
I NEED MY COMPUTER RIGHT HERE
PROPONENT OF LIBERAL ARTS EDUCATION
REMEMBER THOSE THREE POINTS ABOVE
DID YOU LIKE OUR WORK
YOU DO IT LIKE THAT
I THOUGHT THAT WAS A PRETTY GOOD MOVIE
THERE IS A LOT OF PARANOIA AROUND HERE
IN THE FIELD THAT I WAS IN
THE SOCIAL STRUCTURE OF THE SOVIET UNION
IT IS GOING TO BE REDUCED IN PRICE
IT'S NOT ANYTHING ELABORATE
YOU CAN ENJOY YOUR HOBBIES TOGETHER
THE GOVERNMENT AND STATES DO NOT AGREE ON THIS
ON TO THE NEXT ONE
THEY ARE RUNNING THE STORY IN THE NEWSPAPER
THEY WEREN'T DRUG FIENDS
WHAT DIFFERENCE WILL THIS SEPARATE EDUCATION MAKE
I THINK THIS LOOKS FINE
NOT WITH ALL THE OTHER THINGS GOING ON TODAY
THEY ARE TOTALLY DEBT FREE
DO YOU LIKE SUCCESS
I WENT TO MY EXERCISE CLASS ONE DAY
WE CAN GO AROUND THE SCHOOL
HOW DO I SAFELY HANDLE THE WEAPON
IT'S AN EXTERNAL MODEM
HOW DID YOU GET ON IT
I OFTEN FELT THAT IT IS IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO KNOW THIS
WHO'S THAT WOMAN IN THE LIGHT
DO YOU HAVE YOUR BAG
WHEN I WAS IN ENGLAND A FEW YEARS AGO
THEY WILL CHECK OUR BAGS FOR ALCOHOL AND DRUGS
WE PAID INDUSTRY FOR IT
DO YOU VOLUNTEER MUCH THESE DAYS
WE DROVE DOWN TO THE SHORE TO VISIT FRIENDS
PLEASE MAKE YOUR CASE NOW
I GUESS THAT'S KIND OF LIKE THE WAY WE USED TO DO IT
WHERE ARE MY GLASSES
THEY ARE NOT TIRED
I HOPE YOU SEE A GOOD MOVIE SOON
I LOVE TO TALK WITH CHILDREN
HE SHOT A CAREER LOW
I HAVE A FRIEND WHO IS WORKING
WHEN YOU PULL IT UP
FIVE HUNDRED MILES
I COULD DO THIS OR THAT
WHERE THEY MAKE MUSIC
I SAW THAT THE OTHER DAY
PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT HAS TO BE THERE FOR THE KIDS
WE'D HAVE TO BUILD LESS PRISONS
THEY HOPE IT IS OKAY
OF COURSE THEY PAY THEM VERY WELL
PERMANENTLY BECOME A BOOK READER
AND THEN HE LEARNED THE TRUTH
I HAVE ONE DAUGHTER STILL AT HOME
I WANT TO HEAR YOUR VERSION OF THE STORY
IT DOES THE THINGS I NEED FOR IT TO DO
EVERYTHING WAS GOING VERY WELL
THAT IS NICE YOU KNOW
HOW TIRED ARE THEY
I WILL ALSO COME WITH YOU TO EAT
YOUR TUITION REIMBURSEMENT
YOU WATCH IT'LL BE EXACTLY THE SAME
IT'S A LITTLE PIECE OF LAND OVER THERE
THEY HOPE YOU ARE RIGHT HERE
IT'S A LOT OF MONEY
HE DID ALL THE ROOFING WORK BY HIMSELF
THEY HAVE GOT ALL THE AMERICAN SPIRIT THEY NEED
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL REALLY
YOU DON'T HAVE QUITE AS MUCH MONEY
THEY'RE VERY DISSATISFIED
ARE YOU UP TO IT
I LOVE MY TWO LITTLE ONES
BACK TO THE TOPIC AT HAND
WE ARE LIVING ON A FARM
I DIDN'T WANT SOMEBODY TO COME
AND AS ALWAYS I HOPE YOU CAN ENJOY THE ARTICLE
WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GO UP THERE
I CAN'T SEE THEM HERE
I HAVE TO BUY BACK TO SCHOOL STUFF
I KNOW THAT'S A BIG ISSUE
NO YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUT IT DOWN
BUT DO YOU THINK BILL GATES SHOULD RESIGN
GARDENING IN TEXAS IS REALLY INTERESTING
IT IS LOOKING QUITE HARD
I WOULD AND I BELIEVE IN THIS
THIS WAS A GOOD CALL
THE WAY THE LAW READS
THE GIRL IS FOUR YEARS OLD
IT'S TOTALLY RIDICULOUS
THERE'S SO MUCH ON TELEVISION
THAT IS NOT COMFORTABLE
DO YOU LIKE THE SPORTS PROGRAMMING
YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE THE STARS AT NIGHT
ANYWAY I HOPE YOU ENJOY IT AS MUCH AS I DO
SHOWING DATA IS AN EXCELLENT WAY TO PROVE A POINT
I WAS ALSO SPEAKING IN LONGER BLOCKS OF WORDS AND THAT MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO CORRECT ANYTHING TO ONE HUNDRED PERCENT CORRECT
IT'S JUST ME IN THE HOUSE
THEY MAY NEVER REACH THAT AGAIN
THAT'S ANOTHER PROBLEM WITH THE UNITED STATES
A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE
THE CITY IS BUILDING NEW NEIGHBORHOODS AND DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITIES
STAY CLOSE TO THE HOUSE WHEN YOU GO OUT
IT'S REALLY HARD TO KNOW
MY DAUGHTER LIKES THIS CLASS
WE'RE LOOKING AT A CAR SATURDAY
BUT AT MY BROTHER'S HOUSE I TRIED IT
SHE HAS HAD REALLY GOOD LUCK THIS YEAR
I HELPED SOMEONE REPAINT AN APARTMENT
IT WAS AN ACCEPTABLE SOCIAL BEHAVIOR
THEY DON'T GET A LOT OF PARTICIPATION
SCANNED ACROSS THE LITTLE BAR CODE ON OUR BIN
THAT'S ALL I HAVE WITH ME HERE
WHEN I THINK OF DRUG TESTING
I FELT FUNNY IN THIS SPACE
THE GLANDS HAD BEEN REMOVED
DO YOU WATCH CARTOONS A LOT
IT HAD TO BE DONE
TWICE FOR THE SAME CRIME
AN INVOICE EMAIL OR QUOTATION
I'LL TRY THAT NEXT WEEK
THIS IS ONLY ONE DAY'S WORTH OF OBSERVATION SO TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT
WE HAVE ABOUT TEN ACRES
NO I DIDN'T GO TO THE STORE
I MEAN THE SATURDAY NIGHT SPECIAL STUFF
A NEW TYPE OF WORK STATION
THEY WON'T GIVE IT AWAY FOR FREE
WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THE NEWS COVERAGE OF THE WAR
I LOVED HAVING A BOAT TO HANG OUT ON
THE OTHER INDEPENDENT COMPANIES
I KIND OF LOOK AT IT THIS WAY
IN THAT POSITION ON THE BOARD
SHE IS REALLY GOOD AT THIS
SHE WAS ON A CARNIVAL
THOUGH WE CALL IT THE ENGLISH SYSTEM
THEY MAY BE ABLE TO
LAST TIME I SAW THE PAPER EARLIER THIS WEEK
BOTH OF YOU SHOULD MAKE THE DECISION TOGETHER
SCHOOL BUS DRIVERS
IF SOMEONE IS ILL
MY VISION IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM YOUR VISION
THE CAT IS OLDER THAN MY GIRL
THAT WILL CUT POLLUTION TOO
A BUNCH OF PSYCHIATRISTS ARE HANGING OUT
WE HAVE TRIED TO HELP
SHE'S KEPT IT UP REAL WELL
I SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THINGS LIKE THIS
I HAVE A YOUNGER BROTHER LIKE THAT
NOTHING WILL HELP THEM GET ALONG
WE TRAVELED IN EUROPE FOR ABOUT A WEEK
NO HELP IS COMING
I THINK WE SOUND BETTER NOW BECAUSE OF THE PRACTICE
MOST KIDS CAN READ THIS
THIS WAS IN THE LOCAL NEWSPAPER TODAY
TELL MY FAMILY THEY ARE THIRSTY
MY HUSBAND LIKES FUNNY MUSIC
DID YOU START AT THE EDGE
SOME OF THEIR GUIDANCE
I'VE GOT ABOUT TWELVE TICKETS COMING IN THE MAIL
IT CAN TAKE UP TO TWO THREE FOUR OR EVEN FIVE HUNDRED YEARS
THE DECISION WAS ANNOUNCED FRIDAY BY THE PRESIDENCY
I GOT MARRIED AND REGRETTED IT IMMEDIATELY
KITE
WHICH IS THE STRANGEST THING I HAD EVER HEARD
ESSENTIALLY A FRAME IS A MEASUREMENT OF TIME
THE MATERIALS WERE SOLD AT A HIGH COST
HOW MANY DAYS DO YOU NEED
I PICKED IT FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK SOMETHING IS WRONG
I HAVE SOME GAMES THAT WE CAN PLAY
A LOT OF US HAVE PARENTS WHO FOUGHT IN THE WAR
THE GUY WAS A LAW BREAKER
I AM GOING FROM HERE TO THERE
IT IS SOMETHING NEW
WE MET HALF WAY BETWEEN HERE AND THERE
THAT IS PRETTY GOOD
I HOPE THIS PLACE IS AS GOOD AS IT LOOKS
THAT WAS THE WEIRDEST FISHING EXPERIENCE I EVER HAD
COME TAKE A LOOK AT THIS
I HOPE EVERYTHING HERE IS GOOD
I CAN'T REMEMBER THE GUY'S NAME
I HAVEN'T GOTTEN THROUGH IT YET
I NEED TO LOOK INTO THIS
THEY CALLED IT A MISTRIAL OR SOMETHING
MECHANICAL ENGINEER
I REMEMBER LEARNING HOW TO SKI
YOU GET PROGRAMMING
WE LOVE ALL THIS KIND OF STUFF
MY FIRST TWO CHILDREN
I HOPE YOU ALL ENJOY THIS
I'M ORIGINALLY FROM COLORADO
IT IS ALL COMING DOWN NOW
ON ONE OCCASION HE DID TRY TO RAPE ME
IT WOULD BE NICE IF THEY COULD GET THEM ALL TOGETHER
IN MAY IT WILL BE FIVE YEARS SINCE I MET HIM
IT'S GOT MEN AND WOMEN
I PAY A LOT OF TAXES EVERY YEAR
WHAT HELP YOU ARE
WE'RE ONLY JUST A FEW MINUTES AWAY
HOW BAD IS IT GOING
DO NOT TALK TO ME LIKE THAT EVER AGAIN
THEY SAY NO NEW TAXES
I'M IN MIDDLE OF SOME IMPORTANT WORK
I AM PRETTY SURE I NEED LESS THAN THIS
I WENT OUT TO HAVE A GOOD TIME
IT WAS QUITE POPULAR
THE NEW CHAMPION HAS ALREADY BEEN CHOSEN
THEY HAVE EMBARKED ON THE TRIP TO MARS
PROBLEMS THAT MEN HAVE IN THE REALM OF CANCER
ILLINOIS IS STILL AN HOUR AWAY
I HAVE QUITE A COLLECTION MYSELF
HEMP PROVISIONS
YOU LIVE IN SUCH LAVISH STYLE
IT IS FRIGHTENING
I HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT FOR HIM
MY NURSE IS NOT HUNGRY
CALL ME AFTER A COUPLE OF DAYS
THIS IS A COLD SUN ROOM
THE MATCH WAS DEAD AND BURIED AT THIS POINT
BUT LOTS OF TIMES THEY DO
DID YOU GET ANY CARDS IN THE MAIL
THEY SHOULDN'T ALLOW AN APPEAL
THEY GOT TO COME UP WITH IDEAS
DO YOU KNOW SOME KIND OF CAR THAT IS REALLY GOOD
THAT'S REALLY FUNNY BUT ALSO DISTURBING
IT'S NOT ABLE TO FIT IN
WE HAD ANOTHER CAT ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO
WELL I'M NOT GOING THERE
SHE WROTE MY NAME ON A LIST
YOU KEEP UP ON IT ALL THE TIME
SHE ALREADY EXPECTED THE DECISION
I HOPE I NEED MY NURSE
YOU NEED MY GLASSES RIGHT HERE
THIS DEAL DEPENDS ON EMPLOYEES
I AM AROUND IF YOU NEED ME
HE SUPPOSEDLY GOT THIS ONE LAST YEAR
THAT WOMAN SUSPECTED THIS LATELY
IT'S TWENTY ONE THOUSAND
FIRST OFF WE 'D PROBABLY WIND UP WITH A DUD
WHO KNEW WHAT WAS COMING NEXT
I DON'T KNOW WHO THE CHARACTERS ARE
THAT IS HORRIBLE
THAT IS THE HARDEST PART PROBABLY
KEEP THE CAR WITH YOU FOR NOW
I WORK IN THE LEGAL DEPARTMENT
I WILL LEAVE FOR COLLEGE SOON
THE CHARACTER IS TRYING TO SURVIVE
BUT THE TREASURY INSISTED THAT WAS NOT THE CASE
NEEDS TO GET A LOT BETTER AT THE POINT OF ATTACK
I THINK YOU JUST OPEN IT IT UP AND PUT IT IN
WALKING SEEMS TO BE THE BEST
THE TEACHER IS WATCHING US
JOINED THE INITIATIVE
I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
WHAT'S YOUR SECOND FAVORITE FOOD
SECOND ONE COMES IN SEVEN MINUTES
WE MIGHT AS WELL
REPUBLICANS WERE ALSO DISMAYED BY THE DECISION
IT'S GETTING CLOSE
BRING ME MY COMPUTER PLEASE
I THINK THEY ONLY HAVE FOUR BOYS
SHOW ME WHAT YOU HAVE
I SAID IT IS NICE BUT I AM NOT INTO DOING EASY STUFF
WELL I'M ONE OF THOSE RARE GUYS
A CIRCUIT COURT JUDGE
YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE DO SEPARATE THOSE
I OFTEN FIND JOY IN THESE SITUATIONS
AT LEAST THEY ALL SEEM TO HAVE FUN
WHAT DAY IS TODAY
MY COUNTRY IS VERY BIG
THEY HOPE MY FAMILY IS OKAY
I'M GOING TO LISTEN
I COULDN'T STICK AROUND FOR LONG
THE JURY WILL MAKE THE FINAL DECISION
AND I ENJOYED MY GUNS
I CAN REMEMBER WHEN OUR CHILDREN WERE SMALL
I AM IN THE LINE FOR HOURS
A FAIRLY GOOD AMOUNT
YOU MADE IT VERY CLEAR
IT GIVES YOU A TASTE OF WHAT IT'S LIKE
ARE YOU COMING HERE
I WAS RAISED AROUND GUNS
THAT'S ACTUALLY A GOOD QUESTION
IT IS COLD OUTSIDE
NOW DO THINGS LIKE PLANT BUSHES AND TREES
THEY'RE TRYING TO GET THE TEAMS TO COMPETE MORE OFTEN
BE CAREFUL BECAUSE SOMEONE MIGHT FOLLOW YOU HOME
IT'S ALL VOLUNTARY SERVICE
I WAS KIND OF INTO IT FOR A WHILE THERE
I COULDN'T HAVE ASKED FOR ANYTHING BETTER
I THINK IT'S DEFINITELY GOTTEN BETTER
I CAN'T QUITE REMEMBER THE NAME OF THE BOOK
THAT'S NOT THE WORSE THING THAT WE'VE SEEN HAPPEN
ARE YOU ON THE EARLY RETIREMENT
WAS IT A VISION OR A WAKING DREAM
HE WAS FRIENDS WITH MY CHILDREN
JUST LAST WEEK
ARE YOU GOING OUTSIDE
THAT IS JUST NOT RIGHT
PARTICULARLY COMMERCIAL PRODUCTIVITY
I WOULD NOT HAVE
YOU ARE KIND OF BUFF
THEY DON'T HAVE TO DO IT IF THEY DON'T WANT TO
THEY HAVE BEEN A COUPLE OF TIMES
THOSE PROBLEMS WILL NEVER GO AWAY
WITHOUT THE COLLEGE HERE
SHE'S LIKE FIFTY FIVE POUNDS
WE WERE DOING EVERYTHING RIGHT
THEY DO IT BAD
WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME
YOU ARE OUTSIDE
YOU ARE RIGHT HERE
WE SHOULD GO THERE FIRST
THEY ARE SO MUCH GREATER NOW
IT WAS NOT AS SEVERE AS THE SNOW STORM WAS IN PENNSYLVANIA
I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT BEING ABLE TO TURN ON JOY
CAN HE BE THE MAN WHO'S ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE
LIGHT READING
GOOD LUCK AND ENJOY THE GAME
I DON'T THINK THE TEACHERS ARE THE PROBLEM
YOU KNOW THAT CHILDREN CAN'T
THE PAST FEW WEEKS ARE A CASE IN POINT
THEY WERE SENT TO A DRUG REHABILITATION PROGRAM
THERE ARE MANY DECISIONS TO MAKE TODAY
WE DIDN'T BUY REALLY NEW OR EXPENSIVE CARS
VETO
THE GREEN STREET PARKING GARAGE IS CLOSED
READ THE FULL DISCLOSURE HERE
PUT OUT THE TRASH AND STUFF
AND I GUESS MAYBE THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS
I MEAN YOU CAN JUST SIT THIS ONE OUT
THAT IS JUST AS VALUABLE
WHAT DO THEY LIKE
DO I
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT THERE
THERE ARE MANY ADVANTAGES OF USING A PASSIVE VOICE
I HAVE NO OBJECTIONS TO IT
I HAVE NOT SEEN THESE PROBLEMS YET
THEY LIKE IT OUTSIDE
AND YOU GET OUT OF THE HOUSE MORE
YOU DO NOT NEED MY NURSE
THIS WILL MAKE IT LOOK GOOD
I WORKED IN FAST FOOD RESTAURANTS WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE
I HAVE IT VERY GOOD
THIS WILL SOON BECOME TRASH
WHAT MADE YOU GO THERE EARLY
WHAT KIND OF THINGS ARE YOU LOOKING FOR
ARE YOU GOING TO BE AROUND NEXT YEAR
YOUR PLACE IS LOOKING GREAT
I SHOULD THANK ALL OF YOU FOR COMING TODAY
I CAN'T BE AWAY FROM WORK
WE HAVEN'T HAD A REALLY BAD STORM YET THIS YEAR
SOME FLIGHTS WERE DIVERTED DURING THE CLOSURE
IT IS NOT CLEAR IF THIS WAS A CRIME
SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING ANYMORE
I HOPE IT IS GOING
OUR DAUGHTER
THIS IS POSSIBLY ONE OF THE BIGGEST WINS FOR ASIANS IN FILM
IT WILL GET EASIER AS THE DAYS GO BY
THE GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED NEW MEASURES TO COMBAT THE WILDFIRES
TAKE A SEAT AND ENJOY THE RIDE
THAT GUY WAS REMARKABLY INCOMPETENT
YOU MADE IT LOOK VERY NICE
THERE IS A RECEPTACLE
THEY WILL LISTEN TO YOUR WORD
THEY DON'T HAVE THE COURAGE TO DO IT THEMSELVES
IT'S HARD FOR ME TO ADMIT
WHERE THEY TEACH THEM ACADEMIC THINGS
BRING MY FAMILY HERE PLEASE
THERE'S ALWAYS SOMEBODY DIFFERENT
WE'VE EXHAUSTED ALL OF OUR IDEAS
IT DOES NOT QUITE FEEL RIGHT
TO SAN FRANCISCO FOR DINNER OR SOMETHING
AS USUAL THE TRUTH LIES SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN
BEFORE THEY GO TO WORK
I WAS IN ENGLISH AS A MATTER OF FACT
HELLO IS HELP COMING
I LIKE TO USE IT EVERY WORK DAY
IT'S REALLY NICE
WE ARE ALL FINE OVER HERE
IT MEANT SOMETHING BIGGER I THINK
BASED ON WHAT YOU'VE SEEN
WE GENERALLY DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT
THE BALTIC STATES
WHICH TEAM ARE YOU ON
IT IS ENOUGH FOOD FOR A BABY
HOPE IT IS OKAY
THERE'S SOME TREES LIKE THE OAKS
WE REALLY DEBATED AT THE BEGINNING
IF YOU HAVE A DRUG TESTING PROGRAM
NEVER GONNA MAKE YOU CRY
THEN IT WAS FINE
YOU HAVE TO EARN A RIGHT
THEY DO NOT HAVE MY FAITH
TEN GALLON BUCKETS OF WATER
HOW IS YOUR MORNING GOING
WORDS HAVE THE POWER TO BOTH DESTROY AND TO HEAL
THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT WE DO
HIS MAIN POINT IS WRONG SO WE'RE DONE RIGHT
DID YOU GET THE MESSAGE I LEFT
SOMEONE ONCE TOLD ME TO WORK HARD
IF YOU BRING SOME MORE STUFF
AND IT'S A REAL TURN OFF TO SEE
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN DRUG TESTED
I'M NOT REAL SURE HOW THE SONG GOES
AND THEN HE CAME OUT WITH THE INVISIBLE TOUCH
MY GLASSES ARE RIGHT HERE
HAVE A GOOD LIFE
THROW IN A COUPLE OF OVER TIMES FOR GOOD MEASURE
LET US START GOING FROM HERE
SHE THOUGHT ABOUT IT FOR A FEW MINUTES
PASS THE INSPECTION
IF IT IS GOING TO MAKE ANY EFFECT
WHERE HAVE YOU GONE
WE'VE DONE LOTS TO IT
I DO GRAPHICS FOR THEIR TELEVISION STATIONS
AND IT'S GOING TO GO TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER
PLEASE GIVE ME YOUR COMPANY CARD
DECISIONS THAT ARE BEING MADE BY WORLD LEADERS
THE REASON BEHIND THE DECISION
WHAT KIND OF PAINT SHOULD I BUY
I DON'T HAVE ANY GOOD IDEAS
THAT BOY WAS NOT IN THE CLASS TODAY
HE'S JUST KIND OF THERE
DO LITTLE KIDS EVER THINK BEFORE TALKING
FOR ABOUT TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS
EXACTLY WHAT THINGS ARE
DRIVING IN SNOW IS DIFFICULT
ARE YOU A FAN OF SPORTS CARS
I GUESS IT IS RIDICULOUS TO LET THEM KEEP BUILDING IT
I WANT TO DO SOME GARDENING WORK IN THE FLOWER BEDS
WHICH VERSION OF NEWS IS TRUE
BASIC SUPPORTIVE MEASURES AIRWAY PROTECTION
GO TO ANYTHING THAT'S REAL EXPENSIVE
A LOT OF KIDS HOLD OFF FOR A YEAR OR TWO
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT YOU THINK
IT IS GOOD FOR BOTH OF THEM
SHE WAS ALWAYS A LITTLE BIT LEERY OF HER
AT THIS POINT THINGS ACTUALLY WORK PRETTY WELL
SO I HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO GET RID OF IT
DOING LAUNDRY BY HAND AND THAT KIND OF THING
GO TO THE DINING ROOM
NO PLEASE
WERE
THAT'S A WONDERFUL WAY TO GET OFF JURY DUTY
I USE THEM BOTH HERE AT WORK AND AT HOME
IT JUST SEEMS LIKE THERE IS
THAT'S WHAT I SEE BURNING A LOT
IS MY MUSIC VERY BAD
ISN'T THIS VERY GOOD
AT LEAST WE HOPE IT WILL
PLEASE LEAVE SOME FOOD FOR ME TO EAT
THIS WOMAN LIVED THERE FOR SEVEN YEARS
I LOVE GOING TO WATCH A GAME IN ARLINGTON
I LIVE IN A FARMING COMMUNITY
MY FAMILY IS IN KENTUCKY
ARE YOU GOING TO BUY A CAR SOON
WHAT DID YOU SAY JUST NOW
THEY HAD A LADY COME IN
A GIRL AND A BOY
IT NEVER DID RUN RIGHT AGAIN
THE OTHER CASE WAS JUST TRAFFIC
COME I WILL SHOW YOU THE WAY
BUT WE DON'T FIGHT OVER IT OR ANYTHING
I WOULD RATHER EAT COLD FOOD
NO THEY DO NOT CLEAN IT UP
THAT HAS BEEN HER DREAM
I COULDN'T CARE ABOUT ANY OF IT
HERE IT IS
HE MADE OUR HOUSE LOOK VERY PRETTY
HOW IS IT RIGHT
YES AND I THINK WE DO GET PRETTY GOOD COVERAGE
SO WE'RE GOING TO WAIT
I DON'T THINK OF IT AS A PROBLEM
CAN YOU HEAR ME SAY THIS
I TRY TO AVOID THESE PROBLEMS
WELL I REALLY DID NOT KNOW
HE REALLY ENJOYS IT
I GUESS THAT WOULD BE GOOD
THIS BETTER BE GOOD
SHE HAS ANOTHER CHILD THAT YOU HAVE ALREADY MET
NO GOING IN AND OUT
BOTH TEAMS WALKED AWAY WITH JUST ONE POINT EACH
SO I LET MY SON DO IT
I THINK WE HAVE ONE OF THE NICEST YARDS
JUST ADJUSTING TO THAT
WHAT WOULD YOU DO ABOUT
IT HAD EXISTED FOR THREE YEARS
IT REALLY HURTS ME
THEY ARE EQUAL BUSINESS PARTNERS
SHE TAKES AFTER HER MOTHER
IF YOUNG PEOPLE HAD TO DO IT
USUALLY THIS TAKES FIVE DAYS
WHAT IS IT YOU DO HERE
THEY ARE REAL PEOPLE AND THEY ARE INTERESTING
NO ONE CAN DRIVE A TRUCK ON ICE
THAT IS LIKE SUCCESS
SHE GOT BIT ON THE CHEEK
ARE YOU ENJOYING WORKING FROM HOME
IT KEEPS EVERYTHING WET
WATCH THE CAR AND THE HOUSE WHILE WE ARE GONE
THING BE TO CLEAN
I WANT TO MAKE THIS RIGHT
I GREW UP IN NEBRASKA
THEY NEVER GO TO SEE THEM
THEY ALSO SEEM TO BE ECONOMICALLY DRIVEN
HAVE YOU EVER DONE ANYTHING AT ALL
I DO NOT FEEL BAD
EVERYTHING IS JUST DOWN EVERYWHERE
THE PLAY TIME IS WHEN THE PERSON IS FREE
THEN YOU FIND IT AGAIN AND LOSE IT AGAIN
SHE TOOK IT WITH HER
MY DOG WILL AVOID THIS FOOD AT ANY COST
IT WAS DESTROYED BY THE END OF THE YEAR
THOSE ARE RUNNING
I DON'T LIKE HAVING CREDIT CARDS FOR EVERY STORE
THAT MIGHT HELP A LITTLE BIT
THE FOOD COMES OUT FRESH
THERE IS A PLACE TO STAY CLOSE TO MY HOUSE
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN BE THERE
I THINK THAT'S MOST OF IT
SMALL ANIMALS MAKE THE BEST PETS
MY MONEY IS ON THIS TEAM
IT'S PRETTY DIFFERENT FROM YOURS
WHAT WAS THAT OTHER PLACE
IT WAS BEAUTIFUL
HOW GOOD ARE YOU
WE DO SOME PROJECTS EVERY NOW AND THEN
THEY BOUGHT THEIR HOME IN THE SUBURBS
I'VE WORKED HERE FOR A FEW YEARS
THAT WAS TUESDAY NIGHT
I CAN SEE HER OVER THERE
IF THIS WOULD BE HELPFUL
THAT'S GETTING BACK TO A LITTLE BIT CHILLIER
YOU ARE TRYING TO AVOID PAYING TAXES
WE HAVE TO GO WHERE THERE'S RESTROOMS
WHAT ARE YOU DOING RIGHT NOW
ANYBODY IN THE TOP TWENTY
YOU DO NOT LIKE MY NURSE
AND A VERY GOOD AFTERNOON TO YOU
YOU HAVE TO ALLOW YOURSELF TO ENJOY EVERY STEP THAT YOU TAKE
THEY REALLY HIT THAT BALL
CAROL IS POISED TO HAVE A BIG YEAR
PLEASE TAKE THIS STUFF WITH YOU
THERE WERE FIVE OF US AND I DON'T RECALL
JUST AT THE END OF THE MONTH
DO NOT JUST BUY A STOCK THEN WAIT FOR IT TO GO UP
I LIKE LISTENING TO THAT
I KNOW THEY LOST
WE KNOW WHAT TO LOOK FOR AND WHAT TO AVOID
LET'S SELL THESE BOOKS TO KIDS IN SCHOOL
DALLAS COWBOYS VS WASHINGTON REDSKINS
I KIND OF LIKE WATCHING THE COWBOYS I GUESS
NOT ONE INSTANCE
HE HAS BEEN SO PLEASED WITH THE RESULT
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
WITHOUT ANY WARNING WHATSOEVER
AND THEY'RE VERY DEDICATED TO THAT
THAT MUST BE VERY HELPFUL
MOST OF THIS AREA WAS DEVELOPED
I'M SURE THAT YOU CAN RUN A MILE
THIS IS LOOKING VERY GOOD
MY FAMILY IS VERY HUNGRY
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THIS COMPANY
NO I DO NOT FEEL VERY TIRED
IT ALL STARTS TO BECOME SIMILAR
ONE DAY WOULD BE SUFFICIENT
I LIKE TO LISTEN TO PIANO MUSIC A WHOLE LOT
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE
ARE YOU PLEASED WITH THIS DECISION
MORE CLASSES FOR VISUAL LEARNERS
BE GENTLE TO EVERYONE
HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT ALL ALONG
YES IT IS GOOD
I WILL LEAVE FOR THE CITY TONIGHT
WE FOUND THE CAT IN TIME
THAT BOY IS REALLY MAD
MY WIFE AND I BOTH HAVE HAD THAT RECENTLY
I THINK YOU GOT IT
HE HAS AN INDEPENDENT LIFESTYLE
WHY NOT GET THE WHOLE THING
DO YOU ENJOY WORKING ON THIS KIND OF STUFF
THEY REALIZED LATER
FRIENDS BETWEEN SCHOOL AND COLLEGE
YOUR VOICE NEEDS TO BE HEARD
YOU LIKE IT
YOU HOPE THEY ARE COMING
WHAT ABOUT THE JUDGE WHO'S HEARING THE CASE
THAT MUST BE SO NICE FOR YOU
THEY CAN NOT SEEM TO GET AWAY FROM HOME
A LOT OF MY AUNTS AND UNCLES LIVE NEAR HIM
DO YOU LIKE TO PLAY SPORTS
GO IN THE DIRECTION OF A MARKET DRIVEN ECONOMY
I DON'T LIKE TO GUESS
LET ME TELL YOU A FUNNY STORY ABOUT MY KIDS
ANYTHING WILL DO FOR NOW
HE WOULD GET THE GLORY
I THINK THE SERVICE CHARGE IS PRETTY LOW
I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER
MY FAMILY IS COMING
COCONUT OIL IS A HOME REMEDY
IF YOU HAVEN'T DONE IT IN A WHILE
EVERYTHING LOOKS BETTER HERE
THEY LIKE IT CLEAN
I CLEAN UP
SEVERAL THINGS ABOUT THE CAR NEED FIXING
THE DALLAS COWBOYS ARE GOING TO HAVE A PROBLEM IF THEIR QUARTERBACK GETS HURT
PAST COMPANIES WERE ALSO NEAR DALLAS
IN A LITTLE DIFFERENT GRADE
I WILL GIVE IT A SHOT
IT'S A REAL GOOD BOOK
HE DID VERY WELL THERE
THEN YOU COULD SEE HIM AT THE REUNION
THIS IS UNIFYING VOICE WE NEED
AT NIGHT YOU CAN GO WALKING IN THE SHALLOWS
TELL ME A STORY ABOUT YOUR CHILDREN
I'M SURE IT CREATES A LARGE AMOUNT
HE DIDN'T HAVE TOO GOOD OF AN OPINION OF IT
I READ AN ARTICLE ABOUT ASIA
I AM CLOSER
I HELP TIRED NURSE
I HAVEN'T BOUGHT IT NOW FOR ABOUT EIGHT YEARS
YOU HEAR THE CLICK OF THE RECORDING COMING ON
I KEPT SAYING THAT HER SHOW WAS NOT ENTERTAINING
THE WIND'S BLOWING VERY HARD
WHAT CLASS DID HE TEACH
I NEED HELP HERE
THEY JUST TAKE TO IT LIKE CANDY
THEIR VALUES ARE EVERYTHING TO THEM
BUT AGAIN YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT THE TREASURY'S CALL
ILLINOIS STATE AT NORTH DAKOTA STATE
I DO NOT LIKE THAT
SHE WAS CLEARLY ANNOYED AT ME
THEY WERE VERY FLEXIBLE
HAVE YOU EVER TRIED A ONE IRON
I VOTED WITH MY FEET
THEY STILL FOUND HIM GUILTY
WHICH IS OUTSIDE OF DALLAS
IT TURNED OUT TO BE AN EXCELLENT DECISION
I SOLD A BUNCH OF BOOKS THAT I READ
IN LIGHT OF WIDESPREAD SCHOOL CLOSURES
THEY WERE GREAT MEN
OUR MILITARY PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT
IT WAS BASICALLY
I GOT A PAPER CUT
MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER WERE KIDNAPPED
THEY DIDN'T FIGHT TOGETHER
MY FAVORITE BREED OF DOG IS THE AMERICAN GERMAN SHEPHERD
DO YOU GO CAMPING
PEOPLE FROM VIRGINIA VISIT HERE FREQUENTLY
WE WERE PROMISED CIVIL LIBERTIES
YOU NEED IT HERE
WHERE WE MAKE THE SAFETY BAGS
IT SEEMS ABSURD THAT PEOPLE WILL PAY
THIS WOMAN KNEW EXACTLY HOW MUCH TO PAY
THEY NEED MY COMPUTER
I AM NOT LIKE THAT
I DO IT LIKE THAT
BECAUSE OF THE INSTITUTIONAL FOOD
I LIKE IT HERE
THOSE GET THROWN AWAY
TO HER CREDIT SHE DID QUITE WELL
SO WHAT'S NEW WITH YOU
THIS SUMMER WE WENT TO ORLANDO FOR A WEEK
THE COLESLAW AND POTATO SALAD
TEACHERS WILL TEACH LONG DIVISION TO YOUNG CHILDREN
THE NURSING HOME THAT'S JUST A MILE FROM OUR HOUSE
AT LEAST ONE CAT LIVES IN THE HOUSE
I HAD FUN LAST WEEK
I WAS READING SOMETHING IN THE PAPER
IF I'VE GOT TIME
IF THEY'RE GOING TO DO THAT TO HER
DON'T MAKE ME GO THERE AGAIN
HOW LONG AGO DID YOU GRADUATE
WE WILL PROBABLY GO TO THE CONCERT
LUMPING US ALL TOGETHER AS ASIAN AMERICAN
THAT INTEREST RATE IS JUST A KILLER
THEY HAVE YOUR IDENTIFICATION ON FILE
MAYBE YOU GAIN A LITTLE BIT OF LOCAL FAME
FOUNDATION PLANNING
TO CONTINUE FUNDING IT
IT'S REALLY LOOKED ON AS ODD
I DON'T LIKE IT COLD
THAT'S PRETTY AVERAGE TO ME
NEITHER ONE OF US KNEW MUCH ABOUT CARS
THEY'RE GOING TO SCHOOL
NO THEY ARE NOT GOING
WE WENT TO THE SAME HIGH SCHOOL
WHERE ARE THEY GOING TO GET THE MONEY
HE MADE A COLLAGE FOR HIS ART CLASS
I KNEW HOW THIS BUSINESS WORKED
YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY AWARE OF THAT
WE CAN DEDUCT THAT EXPENSE FROM OUR INCOME TAX
I READ A LOT AND THEN I KNOW PEOPLE
WHEN I FIRST SAW THE VISUALS I WAS HOOKED
HE SAID THAT HE WAS LOOKING FOR HIS BOOK
CHILDREN OF MY OWN
EVERYTHING LOOKS SO DIFFERENT IN THE EVENING
HE WAS RATTLING OFF HIS EXCUSES
SO SHE JOINED HER DAUGHTER IN THE CLASSROOM
THE SMALL FISH CAN SWIM AWAY FROM DANGER QUICKLY
THIS IS LOOKING BAD BUT WE WILL MAKE IT
ALTHOUGH I'M NOT VERY GOOD AT IT
I DON'T WANT TO RETURN TO HER APARTMENT AGAIN
YOUNG PEOPLE TO BE
MY BABY CAN WAIT HERE FOR SOME TIME
I WOULD FEEL SO BAD IF I DIDN'T HELP THEM
HERE YOU HAVE IT
AND I WAS TELLING HIM ABOUT A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO
THE MONEY THAT THEY APPARENTLY NEED
WE FELT GUILTY
I THINK IT HAPPENED ABOUT TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS AGO
I DON'T DO MUCH WITH IT
I HAVE SEEN A FEW PEOPLE DO IT THOUGH
I BAKED THEM A CAKE
AT THIS POINT THE GAME WAS WELL AND TRULY UP
ALTHOUGH THEY DON'T ADMIT TO IT
WHY THEY DON'T GO WITH FOURTEEN ONE
IT WAS A LITTLE BIT HARD TO HEAR
THEY BLEW ALL THAT
IT WAS PRETTY CLEAR HERE
WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO GO FIRST
WHAT A PRETTY LITTLE PLACE
THEY DO OKAY
WE DIDN'T REALLY HAVE ONE BEFORE
HIS INFLUENCE IS IMMEASURABLE
DOING THINGS THEY LIKE TO DO TOO
MY HIGH SCHOOL WAS REALLY MY FIRST CHOICE
WHEN YOU FOUND OUT WHO IT WAS
BUT THAT'S NOT REALLY EXACTLY IMMIGRATION
HOUSTON AND SAN ANTONIO
BAH
A LOT OF PEOPLE LOVED THAT SHOW BUT I CAN'T STAND IT
I'M DOING THIS FOR SOMEBODY ELSE
BUT THEY'RE GOING TO LEARN IT SOMETIME
THEY ASKED FOR MY HOME PHONE NUMBER
BASEBALL IS THEIR LIFE
I THINK THEY SHOULD
I NEED GOOD GLASSES
THEY HOPE YOU HAVE MY FAITH
WHERE DID THEY GO
WE MOVED FROM COLORADO
I AM WORKING ON OUR COMPANY TAXES NOW
WHAT DO I HAVE
I GREW UP IN THE CITY BUT I HAVE CHANGED NOW
THANK YOU FOR ENJOYING THIS REGARDLESS
MY VOCABULARY IS PRETTY LIMITED
I'M WORKING QUICK
YOU WEREN'T JUST IN THEIR CLASS
THE FLOWERS CROSS POLLINATE THANKS TO THE BUMBLE BEES
GAS STATIONS JOINTS
BREAKFAST IS KIND OF A FUNNY MEAL
DON'T SPEND OVER THAT
I NEED BAD MUSIC
TO WHERE THE CHILDREN ARE
I WOULD FEEL THAT I HAD THE RIGHT TO
ACTUALLY THE LIONS ARE PRETTY GOOD
MY HUSBAND'S RETIRED
AND CIRCUMCISION HAS BEEN LINKED TO VARIOUS HEALTH BENEFITS
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BELIEVE THIS
AT THIS POINT I HAD A BIT OF A MELTDOWN
DON'T PARTICULARLY CARE FOR THAT AT ALL
IF THERE STARTS TO BE A LOT OF VIOLENCE
WHAT AN AWFUL NEWS TO HEAR IN THE MORNING
FILL THE JAR TO THE TOP WITH BOILING WATER
WHAT CITY ARE YOU CALLING FROM
IF NOT THE BIGGEST YARD
THEY TELL YOU I AM COMFORTABLE
I LIKE HOW YOU TELL IT
PARENTS HAVE TO SPEND A LOT OF MONEY ON A GOOD SCHOOL
MAYBE A LITTLE BIT IN THAT PERSPECTIVE
I AM SURE IT IS NOT AS BAD AS IT LOOKS
HOW BAD IS IT
I THINK IT'S LIKE ONCE A MONTH
THE VISUAL APPEAL OF YOUR ART IS GREAT
I HAD A NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT VERSION BEFORE THIS ONE
I DON'T CARE HOW GOOD YOU LOOK
IT'S EASIER TO TAKE CARE OF A SMALL BABY
THE FACT IS THAT WE WORKED HARD ON THIS
MY FATHER WILL COOK MY FAVORITE FOOD
I HAVE TO ADMIT I'M NOT AS INFORMED AS THEM
I KEEP THINKING THAT THERE'S GOT TO BE A BETTER WAY
IS THERE ANYTHING
DO ABOUT FIFTEEN MILES A WEEK
DO YOU REMEMBER ANYTHING
AT THE BEACH WHEN THE WAVES START COMING IN
PLEASE TELL MY FAMILY
THEY FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE
MY BABY CANNOT STAY TEN MINUTES WITHOUT ME
WHERE A HEAD GASKET BOLT BROKE
THEY NEED YOU
HAVE YOU SEEN THIS MOVIE
I LIKE THOSE TYPES OF RESTAURANTS TOO
ALL THIS POWER HAS GONE IN HIS HEAD
AND THE FIRST ONE
AN ECONOMIC INCENTIVE FOR PEOPLE TO VOTE
CRIMINAL HISTORY
HOW MUCH SPACE DO YOU NEED
I DON'T WANT STUBS IN MY LAWN
OUT OF THE CITY BY MYSELF
TAKE US DOWN TO YOUR NEW HOUSE
IT HELPED HIM TO HAVE A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS PARENTS
AMAZON IS EXPECTED TO MAKE A DECISION THIS YEAR
WHEN THEY GRADUATE
I CONSIDER IT TO BE A CHORE
I FEEL HOPE
ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING
THEY HAD TO ABIDE BY THE RULES
MORE EFFICIENT AUTOMOBILES FOR ONE THING
TEACHERS OF CLASSICAL ARTS IN THE CAPITAL
IT WAS JUST SO MUCH COOKING
I AM COMING
YOU HOPE MY FAMILY IS NOT HERE
FAMILIES LOOK FORWARD TO SPENDING QUALITY TIME HERE
I HAVE KNOWN THIS STORY SINCE I WAS A BABY
IT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT
ARE THEY GOING TO LATER
THAT'S ONE VIEW
TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON
CAN YOU TELL ME HOW YOU EXERCISE
I HAVE NEVER BEEN REAL THRILLED ABOUT THAT
RUB THE CHOPS LIBERALLY WITH THE OLIVE OIL
THERE REALLY NEEDS TO BE A BRIDGE
YES LIKE THAT
EMPLOYEES HAVE ALL THE RIGHTS THAT WORKERS HAVE
ANOTHER THING
THEY DON'T COMPRESS AT ALL
I'M INTO COMPUTERS ALL THE TIME
WE DON'T HAVE CABLE
A LOT OF STUDENTS ARE HIGHLY MOTIVATED
THIS BIG HOUSE HAS A LOT OF SPACE AND LIGHT
PLEASE BRING MY NURSE HERE
THEY SAY YOU CAN'T HAVE PLEASURE WITHOUT PAIN
I JUST DID NOT HAVE TO MAKE THAT CHOICE
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO HAWAII
EMPLOYEES NEED THIS EXPERIENCE TO GROW
IS MY NURSE HUNGRY
MY FAMILY WILL COME HOME NOW
ENTIRELY TOO FAST
THEY WANT THE FUN PART
AT THAT POINT IN TIME IT FELT LIKE A HAIL MARY
THEY HAVE DONATED IT TO CHARITIES
BISCUITS AND GRAVY
DID THEY DO THAT BEFORE YOU WENT IN OR WHAT
THEIR LEAVES ARE STILL GREEN
SHE BECAME LESS ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF HERSELF
AND SO WE USUALLY SIT OUTSIDE
AGAIN I THINK THIS IS NOT THE WAY TO GO
NOT THAT BAD
THAT IS PRETTY UNUSUAL
BECAUSE THAT IS A BULB
WE BEAT BUFFALO
I LIKE TO BE ABLE TO EAT REALLY HEALTHY
I ALMOST FORGOT THE TOPIC
THERE'S ALWAYS THIS FEELING OF HOPE
COULDN'T YOU WAIT TILL THE END OF THE GAME
I GAVE THIS SOME THOUGHT OVER THE WEEKEND
THE CAR ISSUE JUST CAME OUT
IT'S REALLY DRY IN THE DESERT
I LIKE CROSS STITCH TOO
I PAY ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
IF SOMEBODY DOESN'T DO SOMETHING
AT SOME POINT ENOUGH IS ENOUGH
HOW MUCH WORK DO YOU HAVE TO DO NOW
I THINK IT'S PRETTY EXCITING THAT THEY CAN DO THAT
THERE IS A FAN IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS ROOM
JUST A LITTLE SOMETHING THAT'S FEMININE
SOME OF THE LARGER SMALL SCHOOLS
HE JUST PIDDLES ON THIS AND THAT
MY NEW COWBOY HAT WORKED OUT GREAT
SO YOU HAVE YOUR HANDS FULL WITH THEM
SOME COMMENTS ON DESIGN CHOICES
VERY NOT GOOD
I WAS THINKING ABOUT THROWING SOME
WANT TO JOIN OUR AFTER SCHOOL CLUB
WHERE IS MY HOPE
IT'S A PLEASURE TO MAKE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE
I THINK CHILDREN WILL REALLY ENJOY THIS
I MEAN LUNCH TODAY WAS EIGHTEEN DOLLARS
THE EXAMS THEMSELVES ARE NOT EXPENSIVE
I JUST DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME TO READ FOR PLEASURE
THE BUSINESSES AROUND THAT AREA ARE CLOSING
I HOPE THEY DO NOT NEED MY COMPUTER
WILL YOU TAKE BACK WHAT YOU JUST SAID
THEN THEY HAVE NAPS OR REST PERIOD
I HOPE THAT IS
YOU KNOW I DON'T CHANGE MY OWN OIL
I FEEL REALLY BAD THAT IT'S TURNED SO MUCH
AFTER HAVING A ONE THAT WAS HISTORICAL LOOKING
IT SHOULDN'T BE DESTROYED
IT'S BETTER IF I GO IN FIRST
I HOPE THEY FEEL GOOD
MY DOG WILL PLAY WITH HIS FOOD
THEY ARE PRETTY YOUNG
GET THE INTERESTED PEOPLE HERE
KILLER BEE INSTINCT
THIS IS LOOKING GREAT
THE BIG ONE I THOUGHT WAS VERY COMMERCIALIZED
YOU ARE NOT GOING WITH ME
MY PARENTS ARE NOW IN SAN DIEGO
I HOPE THEY ARE THIRSTY
EVERYBODY IS HERE TO HAVE A GOOD TIME
WE PUT THIS STUFF ON
MY MOTHER IS FROM A LITTLE ITALIAN VILLAGE
I DIDN'T MEAN IT LIKE THAT
THAT'S THE FREEDOM OF CHOICE
YOU HAVE MADE THAT VERY CLEAR TO ME
THEY JUST GET AROUND TOWN
YOUR FINAL EXAM IS TO GO ON A THREE MILE WALK
WHAT WE CALL A SUNROOM
SINCE BRIAN WAS BORN
I WANT TO TELL MY FRIENDS WHAT HAPPENED
SOMETHING WITH THEM
PLASTIC DOES NOT BIODEGRADE
MEET MY PLEASURE
IT WAS JUST SOME OLD MOVIE
YOU ARE VERY RIGHT
THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THERE LONGER THAN THAT
HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU HAVE
I FELT LIVING WITH THIS GROUP WAS GREAT
I LIKE TO BAKE OFF AND ON
BELIEVE IN CAPITAL PUNISHMENT
WHEN THINGS DON'T GO RIGHT YOU HAVE TO ADJUST
THAT'S A KIND OF LOW RISK SORT OF PROJECT
I AM A GOLFER
HE'S FAR TOO MUCH OF A GENTLEMAN
YOU SHOULD KEEP IT WITH YOU FOR NOW
BASICALLY THIS HOUSE IS TOO LARGE FOR MY FAMILY
IT'S KIND OF LIKE THE OCEAN WAVES
IF THEY MISSED IT
THE DAYS WERE NICE AND WARM
HOW DOES THIS GRAB YOU
YOU HOPE THEY ARE CLOSER
WITH EVERYBODY IN THE GROUP SO QUIET YOU COULD HEAR A PIN DROP
TO DEAL WITH IN SOME QUALITY WAY
IT TAKES A LOT MORE PLANNING
THEY WILL PLACE YOU IN THE FIRST DIVISION
WE HAVE COMPANY
IT'S FUNNY YOU SAY THAT
WHAT IS THAT
MY GROUP FELT THAT THIS COULD BE MUCH BETTER
HELLO I AM TIRED
WHAT DO YOU WRITE FOR THEM
WE MUST GO THERE NOW
I KIND OF LIKE TO DO A LITTLE BIT OF SEWING
I WILL SEE YOU IN TWO DAYS
I WILL MISS MY WORK TODAY
THIS IS FAR AWAY FROM MY HOME
MY HUSBAND AND I BOTH WENT TO IT
IT'S EASY TO ENJOY THIS COUNTRY
EMPLOYEES LIVING IN TEXAS MADE A DEAL WITH THE COMPANY
HOW DID IT INFLUENCE THEM
I'VE DONE THAT BEFORE
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE IT IS
ALLOWABLE USES AND DISCLOSURES
I THINK IT'S IN OREGON
WE DID GET THE CABLE TV
FIFTEEN YEAR OLDS AND A TWELVE YEAR OLD
YEAH GOOD POINT
I WANTED TO GET TO THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS
JUST MOVE ALONG MY CRAZY BOY
WILL YOU BE GETTING THESE TOYS COME OCTOBER
JUST MOVED HERE
MOST OF THE STORES WILL ACCEPT CASH
I WANT TO GO HOME
NO MY NURSE IS NOT COMING HERE
THIS WON'T TAKE LONG AT ALL
YOU THINK THAT WOULD BE A DETERRENT
THEY'RE GOING TO CHANGE THAT
ACTUALLY THERE'S ONE THING LEFT TO SAY
IT IS CALLED AN INITIAL OFFERING
THIS WAS A VERY ENJOYABLE CONVERSATION WITH YOU
AND THEY GOT HIM FROM THE DOLLAR STORE
IF THERE IS A DECISION TO MAKE THEY SPEAK FIRST
I GOT TO GO FIND A JOB
I KNIT SOMETIMES
I AM DOING QUITE WELL
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING RIGHT NOW
I DIDN'T CATCH ANYTHING
I THINK IT MIGHT BE GOOD FOR THEM
I DON'T REMEMBER GOING THERE AS A CHILD
I KNOW ABOUT THIS TEAM
BRING IT CLOSER
WELL THAT'S TRUE
WHAT'S HIS WHIM TO DECIDE IT SHOULD BE TWO MONTHS
A LOT OF DIFFERENT COMEDIES
I LOVE TALKING TO YOU
YOU EVER SEEN THAT MOVIE
JUST A MOMENT OKAY
IT'S PART OF THE EQUATION
I THINK HE HAD SURGERY ON HIS SHOULDER
THAT IT IS NOT
HAVING READ SUCH A GREAT BOOK FEELS WONDERFUL
I HOPE WE FIND A NICE PLACE
SHE KEPT IN TOUCH LIKE THAT
I HOPE IT IS GOING GOOD
I HOPE MY NURSE IS HUNGRY
OKAY SO I GREW UP IN WEST CHICAGO ILLINOIS
THEY HOPE I HAVE FAITH
I DO FEEL IT
IT'S PROBABLY SITTING OUT ON THE BARGE SOMEWHERE
A PLEA DEAL ALLOWED HIM TO AVOID A LIFE SENTENCE
MY MUSIC IS NOT OKAY
HELLO DO YOU FEEL THIRSTY
I HOPE I DO NOT NEED IT
IT WILL PROBABLY TAKE MORE TIME
THAT WILL BE SOMETHING
I'VE LIVED IN TEXAS FOR FOUR YEARS
WHICH COUNTRY DID YOU VISIT LAST YEAR
FROM SPEAKING FROM MY CHILDREN
IT IS JUST MY HUSBAND AND I
YOU COVER IT
IT'S A REAL BIG CRUNCH
WITH THE CLASSICAL TASTES I HAD MENTIONED
THEY'RE GOING TO GET VERY ANGRY
TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THIS
I DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TODAY
LIKE IT PLEASE
I THINK TODAY THE THING THAT I MISS THE MOST IS MY OLD HOUSE
I DO HAVE FRIENDS WHO HAVE TRIED TO DO MORE
I AM GOING TO A PUBLIC NURSING SCHOOL
HIS SOLUTION WAS TO BURN PLASTIC
IT WAS INNOVATIVE
DO THEY HAVE IT
I CAN NOT BELIEVE
SHE WAS TRYING TO LIVE FAR FROM THE CITY
YES I HOPE YOU ARE
THEY CALL IT A LOW IMPACT AEROBICS
MUSIC SEEMED TO REALLY HELP
THEY WILL CHANGE THIS SYSTEM SOON
SUPER COMPUTER WILL BE HERE SOON
SET IT AWAY TILL YOUR TURN COMES
I'VE NEVER HAD A CAR WITH AUTOMATIC EMERGENCY BRAKES
HE'LL TAKE THEM OUT JUST TO BE WITH THEM
MY HUSBAND HAS A TOOL SHED OUT BACK
THEY HAVE NOT
WHAT IS IT YOU NEED
HE MAKES EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR
ARE YOU A PROFESSIONAL MUSICIAN
THEY HOPE MY NURSE IS OKAY
YOU CAN SIT IN THE SUN ALL DAY AROUND THE POOL
I NEED MY MUSIC
I WAS WORKING THERE SINCE LAST TEN YEARS
I GREW UP IN OKLAHOMA
I GUESS I HAVEN'T SEEN TOO MANY MOVIES LATELY
LUCK AND EXPERIENCE ARE BOTH IMPORTANT
YOUR DAUGHTER WILL CERTAINLY HELP THEM
THAT IS HERE
I ENJOYED IT TOO
I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER
ABOUT A TABLESPOON OF SUGAR
TELL MY NURSE I FEEL COMFORTABLE
IT ALREADY COSTS SOCIETY MUCH MORE BECAUSE OF IT
HE'LL CHANGE OUT A LIGHT SWITCH
HE GOES TO SCHOOL AT NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY
WE DON'T TAKE THE NEWSPAPER TO BEGIN WITH
SHE LOVED DRIVING TO SEE HER FRIENDS
IT WOULD STILL BE HARD EVEN NOWADAYS
GO TO ROOM NUMBER FIVE
THERE WAS A REGIME CHANGE
THEY'RE REALLY KIND OF FASCINATING
MAY I COME IN
I END UP SWITCHING STATIONS FROM TIME TO TIME
I HOPE I FEEL GOOD
YOU WILL HAVE TO GO ALONE FROM HERE
BUT NEWSPAPER ARTICLES CAN SHOW WHAT REALLY HAPPENED
IT WAS SO HARD
I'LL BE HERE IN CASE YOU NEED ME
MY CATS DO THAT TOO
IT WAS AN INTERESTING EXPERIENCE
I ENJOY READING MY FAVORITE BOOK AT NIGHT
THE FIRST DIRECTION THAT I CAN SEE IS UP AHEAD
RIGHT NOW I THINK
THEY WILL DO IT IN GOOD FAITH
WORDS SPELLED WRONG NOT MARKED AS SUCH
WHATEVER YOU SAY THIS FACT WILL NOT CHANGE
I WILL SOON BE ABLE TO TURN AROUND
THEIR HOUSE SHOULD BE VERY CLOSE
PRESIDENT NOW HAS A CHOICE
I'VE LIKED A LOT OF THE NEW MUSIC
THOSE ARE BASIC THINGS
I WILL BRING THIS TO YOU IN A MINUTE
I THINK THAT I DON'T
I CERTAINLY WOULDN'T BE LOYAL TO THEM
SECURITY MEASURES
HERE IN TEXAS THEY DON'T HAVE SNOW
AT WORK THAT DOES THAT
WITH A RECORD LIKE THAT
COME TO SEE OUR WORK
ESPECIALLY THE ONES THAT CAME OUT AND SAID THEIR PIECE
IN OTHER WORDS THERE IS A CHOICE TO MAKE
THE PACIFIC DIVISION HAS A TOTAL OF SIX TEAMS
I'LL LET YOU GO FIRST
SHE SHOULD GET CREDIT FOR HER WORK
I HOPE THAT YOU ARE
IF I HAD A LITTLE CHEDDAR CHEESE
ONE OF THE WORST THINGS THAT COULD EVER HAPPEN
TELL MY NURSE I AM NOT HUNGRY
SO WHAT IS IT NOW
I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT WELL
I AM HERE
BACK TO REGULAR EXERCISE
WHERE ARE THEY GOING HERE
HOW DO YOU AVOID THIS KIND OF TRAGEDY
THEY ARE INTO SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS
THEN YOU REALLY GET SOCKED TO IT
HELLO I LIKE YOU CLOSER
I DIDN'T HAVE THAT MUCH TO DO
A LOT OF THEIR THINGS
I DON'T KNOW HER POLITICAL PREFERENCES
WHAT BASKETBALL TEAMS ARE YOU INTERESTED IN
I AM COMING RIGHT UP
THEY HAVEN'T GONE DOWN
I LEFT ALL MY STUFF AT THE COLLEGE
IT IS RIGHT HERE
IT'S STILL PRETTY RURAL
HE'S PROBABLY ABOUT FIFTY THREE YEARS OLD NOW
I FEEL YOU
SHE WILL GO AROUND EVERY TIME
AND I MADE A QUILT YESTERDAY
JUST A CHANGE OF PACE
GUYS AND GALS WHATEVER THEY ARE
I'M NOT SURE ABOUT HIM THIS YEAR
WE SHOULD THINK TWICE ABOUT IT BEFORE MAKING A DECISION
HOW RIGHT
I WILL GO AROUND
THAT WOULD MAKE A BIGGER MARKET
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH THIS GOVERNMENT
HAVING TWENTY MILLION PEOPLE WATCH YOU DO THAT
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS A PROBLEM
I HAD A DUMP TRUCK COME AND TAKE IT AWAY
I LIKE MY FAMILY
TURN IN YOUR FORMS NOW PLEASE
YOU CAN'T HAVE ANY
IT WOULD BE IN THAT REGION
NOT FOR THE MONEY THAT I WAS GOING TO SPEND
I LIVED THERE FOR A LONG TIME
BUT THEY ARE SO CUTE
THEY NEED THAT
IT IS BAD MUSIC
THE BABY MAY NOT LIKE IT VERY MUCH
IT HAD REAL GOOD TIPS
BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY ITALIANS IN ARGENTINA
THE SAME ACT INCLUDES A CRIMINAL PROVISION
WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT HE DOES
WHAT MUSIC IS IT
HE IS TWENTY YEARS OLD THIS YEAR
A LITTLE BIT WITH REFUGEES
HOW LONG WAS THAT MOVIE
YOU ARE MORE FUN THOUGH
NO I DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE
I DON'T KNOW IF THEY STILL HAVE THEM
A FRIEND OF MINE SAW IT AND SHE SAID IT WAS OKAY
IT'S AN ODD FILM AND IT'S REALLY INTERESTING
THE WATER WAS MURKY AND DARK
DUMP ALL THE TRASH IN THE SAME BIN
PREPARING IS A REAL PROBLEM
NOTHING MAJOR IS GOING ON
I DON'T KNOW THAT ANYBODY KNOWS THE ANSWERS
I USUALLY GO HOME BY THIS TIME
IT REALLY DOES THE JOB
I AM READING A BOOK ON BUSINESS
WE MADE THIS DECISION AT WORK
PUT THE OLD NOSE TO THE GRINDSTONE
HOW ARE YOU GOING OUTSIDE
I'VE HEARD HIM TALK ABOUT THAT FOR HOURS
AND THEN WE RENT THEM FOR A WEEK
DIDN'T HAVE A PLACE TO PUT THEM
SHE JUST LOVED THIS LITTLE DOG
BECAUSE IT'S NOTHING THEY CAN'T HANDLE
I WOULD NOT MIND HAVING ONE
MY FAMILY IS IN THE CITY RIGHT NOW
THEY'RE ALL GONE AT THIS POINT
DO THEY
IN THIS EQUATION THERE ARE TWO VARIABLES
I HOPE THEY NEED FAITH
WE'RE GOING TO TRY AND HAVE HER STAY HOME
WHO DID YOU WORK FOR BACK IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
THEY WILL WEAR IT WITH A NICE TOP
I THINK THIS IS NOT VERY HARD
TOOK THEM ABOUT AN HOUR TO COMPLETE
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO CATCH ANY OF THAT
NOT TOO LONG AGO
YOU CAN SEE WHAT I MEAN
HOW SERIOUS A PERSON IS
EVERYTHING IS LOOKING GOOD
WELL I GUESS I ALSO HAVE BEEN READING
MY FAMILY IS GOING UP
AND NOT VERY HARD BECAUSE IT IS DIFFICULT TO DETACH
YES I CONSIDER MYSELF WHAT THEY CALL A FULL TIMER
I ALWAYS HAD A POINT TO PROVE TO MYSELF
THEY'RE NOT REALLY EVEN PARTICIPATING
I FEEL COMFORTABLE
THEY WERE ALL COMPLETELY CLEAN
THEY ARE NOW STARTING TO MAKE THEM
ARE YOU A FAMOUS TELEVISION STAR
HOW PEOPLE REACT TO THINGS AND STUFF
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
I HAVE TO GET TO KNOW THIS AREA A LITTLE BETTER
I LIKE TO WATCH ALMOST ALL FOOTBALL
MY DAUGHTER WENT TO SEE THAT MOVIE TOO
READ A LOT OF SCIENCE FICTION WORK
AWAY FROM HIS WIFE
OF COURSE AT THAT POINT WE SIMPLY COULD NOT AFFORD IT
TRY SOME OF YOUR BAKING
TRY A LITTLE TASTE OF IT AND SEE WHAT YOU THINK
DO YOU WORK AT HOME ALL THE TIME
IT'S A VERY EXPENSIVE AUTOMOBILE
AS USUAL HE DID AN AMAZING JOB
THE HEADLINES ON THE NEWS ARE SCARY
TWO DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY
IN CONCLUSION THIS IS A GREAT SKILL TO HAVE
I WAS VERY LATE AS I HAD TO WALK
THIS WILL GIVE YOU SOME PEACE OF MIND
MY WIFE GOT IN TROUBLE ONE TIME WITH HERS
IT'S NOT AT ALL ANYTHING WORTH TALKING ABOUT
IT IS RIGHT
WE WENT THERE FOUR HOURS AGO
I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED READING
IT'S NOT YOUR DECISION TO MAKE
THIS WAS A UNIQUE POINT IN THE HISTORY OF THE SHOW
THERE WAS SOMEBODY THERE FOR THEM
WHATEVER THE JURY SAYS WILL BE THE LAW TODAY
THE OFFICER SAID NOTHING BUT LAUNCHED A BARRAGE OF PUNCHES
THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA IS NOTHING LIKE THAT
I MARRIED INTO A MILITARY FAMILY
THAT'S NEAT ISN'T IT
I LIKE DOING THAT PART
I REALLY DID ENJOY THE LAW
I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE
I LOVE TO HEAR CLASSICAL MUSIC
THEY DON'T RECOGNIZE ANY TIME DIFFERENCE
I DON'T THINK HE'S MAKING NEW ONES
I AM JUST ANOTHER PERSON
EVERYTHING IS A LONG STORY
WHAT ABOUT IN INTERNATIONAL SOCCER MATCHES
I READ A BOOK WHILE I'M DOING IT
I'M NOT THINKING TOO WELL
HOW HUNGRY ARE THEY
I'M GOING TO SCHOOL WHILE I'M WORKING
SOME OF US ARE ABOUT TO COME BACK
IS MY FAMILY VERY COMFORTABLE
YOU ARE ALWAYS THE FIRST ONE TO COME
I DON'T THINK I'VE HEARD ANYTHING ON THE RANGERS
THERE'S SO MUCH GOING ON HERE
WHERE AM I GOING
DO YOU HAVE INTEREST IN THIS COMPANY
CORRESPONDENCE SCHOOL
THE ORIGINAL GERMAN VERSION IS HERE
MY WIFE WENT TO THE STORE AS USUAL
BE SAFE TAKE YOUR TIME AND ENJOY THE VIEW
I THINK WE USED IT FOR THE CHRISTMAS TREE
SHE'S IN A NURSING HOME
THE TRIAL IS NOW MOVING TOWARDS A CONCLUSION
I DON'T HAVE TOO MUCH ON CREDIT CARDS
I BRING IT RIGHT UP
AN ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN CHICAGO
YOU COULD NEVER BRING THEM BACK
IT'S KIND OF A DEPRESSING TOPIC
OK SO WHAT'S THE POINT
DID YOU FIND WHAT YOU WERE LOOKING FOR
THIS WILL NOT GO DOWN WELL EITHER
THAT WAS AN ARTICLE IN THE WASHINGTON POST
MY FAMILY WILL JOIN US IN A WHILE
MY MOM'S HELPING ME OUT
TWELVE MEN TRIED AND TRUE
WHY DON'T YOU DO SOMETHING WITH THOSE BOXES
JUST FOR THE RECORD
DO THEY HAVE MY COMPUTER
I'LL STICK WITH IT WHILE IT'S GOOD
I AM LIKE YOU
LISTEN TO THE MAN HEAR THE VISION
SHE CAN DO PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING
WHEN YOU MAKE THAT POINT IT UPSETS PEOPLE
I MEAN SOMEONE IN THE PROCESS OF RAPE
I TAKE IT SHE WAS AN ACCOUNTANT
I MEAN MY HOME HAS EVERYTHING
YOU'RE RIGHT THERE'S A BIG CHANGE
THOSE LOOK VERY PRETTY
IT LOOKS LIKE A LITTLE SHOT GUN HOUSE
THAT PICTURE IS TAKEN RIGHT OUT OF A MAGAZINE
HOW FAR ARE YOU FROM ME
WHAT ARE THEY DOING HERE
JOIN US TODAY
I AM THIRSTY
AND IF YOU'RE TRYING TO HOLD OUT
SHE IS INTO A LITTLE BIT OF EVERYTHING
WHICH LEADS ME TO MY NEXT POINT
I NEED TO GET BETTER AT IT THOUGH
THEY DO NOT HAVE NURSE
IT WAS A HUNG JURY
WALKING IS KIND OF BORING
FIRST THING I DID
ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF HOUSTON TEXAS
MANY OF THOSE DECISIONS HAVE BEEN OVERTURNED BY HIGHER COURTS
I BET THAT WOULD BE
IT IS UP
FIVE THIRTY AND SIX THIRTY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
I HOPE MY NURSE IS OKAY
I THINK THIS IS TOO MUCH FOR ME
I MEAN I'M DRIVING A PIECE OF JUNK
HE WASN'T GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER DOG
IN ANY SITUATION HE MAINTAINS HIS COMPOSURE
THAT'S WHAT I'M MAJORING IN
ARE YOU FROM THERE ORIGINALLY
THEY ARE VERY BAD
ON TWO OCCASIONS IN THE PAST TWELVE
WE WERE IN THE LINE FOR HOURS
YES IT IS VERY BAD
IN A TOWN ADJACENT TO OURS
FUTURE VERSIONS OF THE HEADSET
I ALWAYS WATCH THEM NO MATTER WHO'S ON
SOCIAL RECYCLING PROGRAM IS GOING GREAT
MY HUSBAND SAYS I DO IT
THE GRASSROOTS WERE WHACKED FOR VOICING OUT
WHO WOULD THEY ASK
I THINK I WAS PAID
I DO HAVE HOPE
QUITE A LOT OF VARIETY
WHILE IT'S HEALING YOU NEED TO TAKE IT EASY
IT SEEMS LIKE WE SHOULD HELP THEM
WE STARTED WATCHING AGAIN
YES I DO
I JUST DO IT ALL
HE LIKES DRIVING FOR MILES AND MILES IN THE COUNTRY
POUR IT INTO A GLASS SERVE AND ENJOY
THE ORGANIZATION CAN USE THE HELP TOO
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT
IT MUST HAVE BEEN SORT OF INTERESTING TO US
IT'S EASY TO SAY
LIVERPOOL HAVE A BIG DECISION TO MAKE FOR NEXT SEASON
MY FRIEND MOVED TO TEXAS
CONVEYED SOMETHING OF THE CONFUSION UNCERTAINTY AND REBELLION OF YOUTH
WE WILL COME AFTER SOME TIME
IT TASTES DIFFERENTLY
YOU DIDN'T OVERHEAT THE FOOD
IT'S SIMPLY NOT TRUE THAT HE COULDN'T MAKE A DECISION
WE GOT HAIL THE SIZE OF MARBLES
